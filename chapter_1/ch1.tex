\chapter{introduction}
Antibiotics have nearly eliminated premature death from bacterial infections in most parts of the developed world, to the extent that effective treatment is now often taken for granted~\cite{Hawkey2008}.
The threat to this achievement posed by antibiotic resistance was recognized early, for instance by Kirby (1944), and explicitly highlighted by Alexander Fleming in his 1945 Nobel Prize speech.
Today, this threat has materialized: antimicrobial resistance (AMR) contributed to an estimated 4.71 million deaths in 2021, with 1.14 million deaths directly attributable to resistant infections~\cite{Naghavi2024}.
The possibility of returning to a world where antibiotics are largely ineffective underscores the importance of understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces shaping AMR.

Evolution of antibiotic resistance is driven by two key processes: mutation and selection. Resistance genes arise de novo through mutations, occurring either on bacterial chromosomes or on extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements that replicate independently, such as plasmids (small circular DNA molecules) or bacteriophages (viruses targeting bacteria). Once established, these genes can spread vertically—passed from a mother cell to its offspring during cell division—or horizontally, whereby previously susceptible cells acquire resistance by taking up foreign DNA, e.g. via plasmid conjugation.
While some plasmids are transmitted only vertically, others can transfer horizontally between bacterial cells via conjugation. During conjugation, plasmids initiate the formation of a pilus, a physical tunnel connecting cells, allowing DNA transfer.
This mechanism facilitates gene exchange across bacterial lineages and even species boundaries~\cite{Frost2005, Smillie2010}.

Whether these emerged resistance genes can persist depends on selection.
Selection is shaped by the interplay between (i) pharmacokinetics (PK), which describes how drug concentrations change over time within the host, and (ii) pharmacodynamics (PD), which describes how these concentrations influence bacterial population dynamics~\cite{Regoes2004}.

Each use of antibiotics imposes selective pressure on microbial populations, which can favor the emergence or spread of resistant variants.
This is consistent with the widely accepted view that antibiotic use is the main driver of resistance evolution~\cite{Gregory2018}.
However, because infections can be life-threatening, antibiotic use is often unavoidable, creating a trade-off between effective treatment and the risk of selecting for resistant bacteria.

This raises the fundamental question of how to best use antibiotics to treat infections; with and without knowledge about the phenotypic properties of the infecting pathogen.
Furthermore, this question arises at multiple biological scales: within individual hosts, where antibiotic concentrations and bacterial populations interact dynamically; and between hosts, where treatment strategies influence the transmission and spread of resistance at the population level.
Both scales are relevant for evaluating the effectiveness and evolutionary consequences of antibiotic use.

\subsection{Treatment Strategies and Combination Therapy}
In an ideal scenario, the treatment of infections is tailored to the resistance phenotype of the infecting pathogen.
However, in clinical practice this is often not feasible: in emergency settings, immediate treatment is required and microbiological characterisation typically takes 24 to 72 hours~\cite{Leekha2011}; resistance may exist below detection thresholds, rendering diagnostics inconclusive; and in prophylactic contexts such as surgery or treatment of immunocompromised patients, antibiotics are often prescribed preemptively.

In such cases of limited information, clinicians rely on empirical treatment strategies that aim to minimize the risk of selecting for resistance.
Commonly discussed approaches include combination therapy (simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics), mixing (random patient allocation to different antibiotics), and cycling (periodic rotation of antibiotics over time).
Among these, combination therapy, which was first introduced in agriculture to prevent resistance in plant pathogens~\cite{Kable1980, Delp1980, Skylakakis1981} is often considered the most promising strategy in theoretical models~\cite{Bonhoeffer1997, Tepekule2017,Uecker2021}.

However, concerns persist.
One major concern is that combination therapy might accelerate the selection for resistance, given the observed correlation between overall antibiotic consumption and resistance [gregory], not only regarding the targeted pathogen but also for the microbiome~\cite{...}.
Furthermore, combining antibiotics may impose a higher burden on patients, for example through an increased risk of toxicity~\cite{Tamma2012}.

In the clinical context combination therapy plays a central role in clinical protocols for rapidly evolving pathogens such as \textit{HIV}, \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}, and \textit{Plasmodium falciparum}~\cite{Goldberg2012}.
Nonetheless, the clinical evidence remains inconclusive.
A recent meta-analysis found no consistent advantage of combination therapy in preventing resistance across bacterial infections~\cite{siedentop_metaanalysis_2024}.
The discrepancy between theoretical predictions and inconclusive clinical outcomes can stem both from limitations in modelling or clinical study design.
On the theoretical side, models often rely on simplifying assumptions and may overlook important biological complexities, such as heterogeneity in patients, pathogens, and treatment responses.
On the clinical side, most trials are not designed to detect resistance outcomes and are therefore underpowered for this purpose~\cite{siedentop_metaanalysis_2024}.
Additional variability arises from differences in study design, pathogens, treatment regimens, and clinical endpoints.
Moreover, the choice of antibiotic combination itself can increase or decrease treatment success, further contributing to outcome variability.

To bridge the gap between theoretical models and clinical studies, Angst et al.~\cite{Angst2021} developed an \textit{in vitro} experimental setup mimicking within- and between-host dynamics under different treatment strategies, and showing that combination therapy typically best prevents resistance emergence best.

They compared the effects of combination therapy, mixing, cycling, monotherapy, and no treatment (control) on the evolution of chromosomal resistance to streptomycin and nalidixic acid in \textit{Escherichia coli}.
Their results showed that combination therapy was the most effective in preventing resistance evolution, while mixing and cycling were less effective, but still outperformed monotherapy in most cases.

In Chapter~2, we refine this framework to study plasmid-mediated resistance, confirming that combination therapy generally outperforms other strategies, but also uncovering conditions under which mixing, cycling, or monotherapy perform equally well or better.
Our results confirmed that combination therapy remains the most effective strategy even for plasmid-borne resistance, with mixing and cycling again performing better than monotherapy in most scenarios.

\subsection{Population Dynamics under Combination Therapy}
To better understand the potential of combination therapy, a deeper insight into drug interactions is needed.
Drug interaction studies evaluate how the combined effect of two antibiotics compares to a predicted neutral effect derived from their individual actions.
Two classical null models are typically used for this purpose: the Loewe additivity model~\cite{Loewe1926} and the Bliss independence model~\cite{Bliss1939}.
Numerous studies have investigated drug interactions below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)~\cite{Yeh2006}, (\cite{...}) providing valuable insights into sublethal interactions.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings extend to the super-MIC range, where antibiotics are expected to kill bacteria.
This uncertainty arises from the scarcity of studies exploring interactions above the MIC.

The reason for this is methodological: to quantify treatment effects, we estimate the exponential change in time-series population curves.
Below the MIC, bacterial growth is typically quantified using optical density (OD), which allows for high-throughput measurement.
However, OD does not distinguish between live and dead cells, making it unreliable for estimating net growth rates above the MIC.
At super-MIC concentrations, colony-forming unit (CFU) assays remain the gold standard, but they are labor-intensive, costly, and can become unreliable at high drug levels.

To address this limitation, Chapter~3 explores the reliability of luminescence assays, a high-throughput alternative to CFU assays, assessing their validity in measuring bacterial growth dynamics at inhibitory antibiotic concentrations.
We found clear limitations for both the CFU and the luminescence assays; and conditions where they work well and where they do not.

Using this method, Chapter~4 explores the pharmacodynamics of drug interactions among six antibiotics: amoxicillin, colistin, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, polymyxinB, and tetracycline.
In total, we measured interactions for 2160 drug-combination-concentration pairs.
We extended the standard pharmacodynamic formalism to describe combination treatments using polar coordinates and compared the resulting curves to predictions from the Loewe additivity and Bliss independence models.

\section{Thesis outline}

In this thesis we develop experimental and analytical methods to quantify how antibiotic‑induced
selection pressure shapes the evolution and transmission of resistance at both within‑host and between‑host scales.

In Chapter~2, we use an \textit{in‑vitro} hospital‑ward model, to compare three multidrug strategies (combination, mixing, cycling), two monotherapies (Mono A, Mono B) and an untreated control.
We show that combination therapy suppresses plasmid‑borne double resistance most
efficiently under the majority of conditions, but also find that in certain scenarios, mixing, cycling, or even monotherapy can perform equally well or better.
Surprisingly, we find that omitting treatment entirely can accelerate the emergence of multi-resistance—a phenomenon specific to plasmid-mediated resistance dynamics.

In Chapter~3, we assess the applicability of luminescence assays as a high‑throughput method for estimating net growth above the MIC, benchmark them against CFU counts, and develop a mathematical framework that explains when each read‑out reflects biomass, viable cell number, or neither.
We find that light intensity correlates more closely with biomass than with viable cell number, which leads to discrepancies in growth-rate estimates under conditions that induce filamentation.

In Chapter~4, we build on the validated luminescence workflow, and use it to map net‑growth surfaces for $2160$ drug–drug–concentration combinations, using six antibiotics.
From these data, we derive interaction parameters for each pair and compare them to the expectations under Loewe additivity and Bliss independence.
We find that the classification of drug interactions can shift between sub- and super-MIC ranges, implying that interaction types at sub-MIC levels do not necessarily generalise to inhibitory concentrations.
Furthermore, we extend the pharmacodynamic formalism to polar coordinates, allowing us to analyse how pharmacodynamic parameters of individual drugs combine under co-treatment.
