            Schematic illustrating the procedure used in the experiment for transfers T and T+1  in the liquid handling platform after adding medium and drugs to the \textit{assay plates}. 
            Every transfer (day), we provide new  \textit{assay} and \textit{agar plates}. 
            Plates from the previous transfers are removed.
            To inoculate the new \textit{assay plates} with newly admitted patients from the strain plate, along with staying patients and infection between patients from the previous \textit{assay plate}, we use a pintool with retractable pins (dashed lines). 
            Discharged patients are not transferred (pins retracted) to the new assay plates. 
            Plates are then automatically transferred (solid lines) to the incubator for overnight incubation. Subsequently, we replicate each \textit{assay plate} onto four agar plates using the pintool. These plates are treated with antibiotics A, B, and AB, and one remains untreated. Once the agar plates have been incubated overnight, we capture images (dotted lines) to determine the resistance profile $\phi_i$ for each well $i$.}

    \caption{Illustration depicting the various sources of stochasticity and variation in experiments and simulations.
    Our experiments and simulations investigate various sources of stochasticity and their contributions to the variability of the outcome. In panels \textbf{A}-\textbf{D}, we sketch the different sources of stochasticity for each experiment and simulation, highlighting our primary focus in red.
    \textbf{(A) \textit{In vitro} Experiment.} Each experiment explores a scenario and is defined by a distinct parameter set (\textit{prevention} (P), \textit{containment} (C), \textit{maximum emergence} (E)). We randomly generated one instruction set for each parameter set~$i$: \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{1}}. For each instruction set \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{1}}, we replicated the cumulative in-well dynamics four times \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!r^{1}_{j}}.
    \textbf{(B) Validation Simulation.} To assess our computational model, we employed identical parameter sets and instruction sets \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{1}}, as employed in the \textit{in vitro} experiments. For each instruction set \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{1}}, we conducted 100 stochastic simulations \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!s^{1}_{j}}.
    \textbf{(C) Variation Simulation.} For every \textit{in vitro} parameter set, we randomly generated 100 alternative instruction sets \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{k}} to quantify the influence of experimental decisions on the experiment's outcomes. For each instruction set, we performed one simulation \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!s^{k}_{1}}.
    \textbf{(D) \textit{In Silico} Sensitivity Analysis.} 
    We examined the sensitivity of our experimental findings to the input parameters by examining the effects of varying the input parameters on the resulting frequency of uninfected cases for different treatment strategies. To achieve this, we generated 20{,}000 alternative parameter sets \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!p}. We created ten randomised instruction sets \ensuremath{{}^{i}\!z^{k}} for each parameter set~\ensuremath{{}^{i}\!p} and simulated each instruction set one time (\ensuremath{{}^{i}\!s^{k}_{1}}).}
