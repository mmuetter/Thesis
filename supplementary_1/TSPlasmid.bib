abstract = {When and under which conditions antibiotic combination therapy decelerates rather than accelerates resistance evolution is not well understood. We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics. We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials' risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. 42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95{\%} CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77{\%}). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions. The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.},

abstract = {Antibiotics have been used to cure bacterial infections for more than 70 years, and these low-molecular-weight bioactive agents have also been used for a variety of other medicinal applications. In the battle against microbes, antibiotics have certainly been a blessing to human civilization by saving millions of lives. Globally, infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are on the rise. Antibiotics are being used to combat diversified bacterial infections. Synthetic biology techniques, in combination with molecular, functional genomic, and metagenomic studies of bacteria, plants, and even marine invertebrates are aimed at unlocking the world's natural products faster than previous methods of antibiotic discovery. There are currently only few viable remedies, potential preventive techniques, and a limited number of antibiotics, thereby necessitating the discovery of innovative medicinal approaches and antimicrobial therapies. MDR is also facilitated by biofilms, which makes infection control more complex. In this review, we have spotlighted comprehensively various aspects of antibiotics viz. overview of antibiotics era, mode of actions of antibiotics, development and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and future strategies to fight the emerging antimicrobial resistant threat.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer, mediated by conjugative plasmids, is a major driver of the global rise of antibiotic resistance. However, the relative contributions of factors that underlie the spread of plasmids and their roles in conjugation in vivo are unclear. To address this, we investigated the spread of clinical Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing plasmids in the absence of antibiotics in vitro and in the mouse intestine. We hypothesised that plasmid properties would be the primary determinants of plasmid spread and that bacterial strain identity would also contribute. We found clinical Escherichia coli strains natively associated with ESBL-plasmids conjugated to three distinct E. coli strains and one Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain. Final transconjugant frequencies varied across plasmid, donor, and recipient combinations, with qualitative consistency when comparing transfer in vitro and in vivo in mice. In both environments, transconjugant frequencies for these natural strains and plasmids covaried with the presence/absence of transfer genes on ESBL-plasmids and were affected by plasmid incompatibility. By moving ESBL-plasmids out of their native hosts, we showed that donor and recipient strains also modulated transconjugant frequencies. This suggests that plasmid spread in the complex gut environment of animals and humans can be predicted based on in vitro testing and genetic data.},

abstract = {Multiple treatment strategies are available for empiric antibiotic therapy in hospitals, but neither clinical studies nor theoretical investigations have yielded a clear picture when which strategy is optimal and why. Extending earlier work of others and us, we present a mathematical model capturing treatment strategies using two drugs, i.e the multi-drug therapies referred to as cycling, mixing, and combination therapy, as well as monotherapy with either drug. We randomly sample a large parameter space to determine the conditions determining success or failure of these strategies. We find that combination therapy tends to outperform the other treatment strategies. By using linear discriminant analysis and particle swarm optimization, we find that the most important parameters determining success or failure of combination therapy relative to the other treatment strategies are the de novo rate of emergence of double resistance in patients infected with sensitive bacteria and the fitness costs associated with double resistance. The rate at which double resistance is imported into the hospital via patients admitted from the outside community has little influence, as all treatment strategies are affected equally. The parameter sets for which combination therapy fails tend to fall into areas with low biological plausibility as they are characterised by very high rates of de novo emergence of resistance to both drugs compared to a single drug, and the cost of double resistance is considerably smaller than the sum of the costs of single resistance.},

abstract = {The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of action. Mechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., $\beta$-lactams and glycopeptide agents), inhibition of protein synthesis (macrolides and tetracyclines), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (fluoroquinolones and rifampin), inhibition of a metabolic pathway (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and disruption of bacterial membrane structure (polymyxins and daptomycin). Bacteria may be intrinsically resistant to ≥1 class of antimicrobial agents, or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organisms. Acquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug, to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target, to modify the drug's target site, or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drug. Acquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the host's genome or plasmids. Use of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Herein 3 case histories-one involving Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, another focusing on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a third detailing multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-are reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections is a growing threat to public health. Recent evidence shows that when exposed to stressful conditions, some bacteria perform higher rates of horizontal gene transfer and mutation, and thus acquire antibiotic resistance more rapidly.Methods: We incorporate this new notion into a mathematical model for the emergence of antibiotic multi-resistance in a hospital setting.Results: We show that when stress has a considerable effect on genetic variation, the emergence of antibiotic resistance is dramatically affected. A strategy in which patients receive a combination of antibiotics (combining) is expected to facilitate the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria when genetic variation is stress-induced. The preference between a strategy in which one of two effective drugs is assigned randomly to each patient (mixing), and a strategy where only one drug is administered for a specific period of time (cycling) is determined by the resistance acquisition mechanisms. We discuss several features of the mechanisms by which stress affects variation and predict the conditions for success of different antibiotic treatment strategies.Conclusions: These findings should encourage research on the mechanisms of stress-induced genetic variation and establish the importance of incorporating data about these mechanisms when considering antibiotic treatment strategies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Obolski and Hadany; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Some transformable bacteria have acquired target-mediated antibiotic resistance by horizontal genetic exchange of fragments of chromosomal genes. The resistant strains express variants of the antibiotic target that are metabolically active but exhibit a lowered affinity for the antibiotic. The alleles encoding these resistant proteins are mosaics comprising DNA derived from the host and other bacteria, often members of a different species. Examples include penicillin-resistant penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in Streptococcus pneumoniae and the pathogenic Neisseria species and sulfonamide-resistant dihydropterate synthase in Neisseria meningitidis. Distinct mosaic alleles encoding antibiotic resistance have arisen on multiple occasions, indicating the mobility of chromosomal genes in these species. Mosaic genes can arise at any chromosomal locus, and S. pneumoniae organisms with high-level penicillin resistance have acquired mosaic PBP genes at three separate pbp loci. Furthermore, horizontal genetic exchange permits movement of alleles among bacterial lineages, increasing the opportunities for the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

Positive selection for plasmid-coded functions is a major driver of plasmid evolution, while plasmids that do not confer a selective advantage are considered costly and expected to go extinct. Yet, plasmids are ubiquitous in nature, and their persistence remains an evolutionary paradox. Here, we demonstrate that non-mobile plasmids persist over evolutionary timescales without selection for the plasmid function. Evolving a minimal plasmid encoding for antibiotics resistance in Escherichia coli, we discover that plasmid stability emerges in the absence of antibiotics and that plasmid loss is determined by transcription-replication conflicts. We further find that environmental conditions modulate these conflicts and plasmid persistence. Silencing the transcription of the resistance gene results in stable plasmids that become fixed in the population. Evolution of plasmid stability under non-selective conditions provides an evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of plasmids in nature.},

The specificity of the method was tested on a collection of 61 reference plasmids and on 20 Salmonella enterica strains of different serotypes isolated in Italy. Results indicated that the inc/rep PCR method demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in detecting replicons on reference plasmids and also revealed the presence of recurrent and common plasmids in epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella isolates of different serotypes.

abstract = {The rise of resistance together with the shortage of new broad-spectrum antibiotics underlines the urgency of optimizing the use of available drugs to minimize disease burden. Theoretical studies suggest that coordinating empirical usage of antibiotics in a hospital ward can contain the spread of resistance. However, theoretical and clinical studies came to different conclusions regarding the usefulness of rotating first-line therapy (cycling). Here, we performed a quantitative pathogen-specific meta-analysis of clinical studies comparing cycling to standard practice. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar and identified 46 clinical studies addressing the effect of cycling on nosocomial infections, of which 11 met our selection criteria. We employed a method for multivariate meta-analysis using incidence rates as endpoints and find that cycling reduced the incidence rate/1000 patient days of both total infections by 4.95 [9.43-0.48] and resistant infections by 7.2 [14.00-0.44]. This positive effect was observed in most pathogens despite a large variance between individual species. Our findings remain robust in uni- and multivariate metaregressions. We used theoretical models that reflect various infections and hospital settings to compare cycling to random assignment to different drugs (mixing). We make the realistic assumption that therapy is changed when first line treatment is ineffective, which we call "adjustable cycling/mixing". In concordance with earlier theoretical studies, we find that in strict regimens, cycling is detrimental. However, in adjustable regimens single resistance is suppressed and cycling is successful in most settings. Both a meta-regression and our theoretical model indicate that "adjustable cycling" is especially useful to suppress emergence of multiple resistance. While our model predicts that cycling periods of one month perform well, we expect that too long cycling periods are detrimental. Our results suggest that "adjustable cycling" suppresses multiple resistance and warrants further investigations that allow comparing various diseases and hospital settings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Abel zur Wiesch et al.},

abstract = {High antibiotic resistance frequencies have become a major public health issue. The decrease in new antibiotics' production, combined with increasing frequencies of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, cause substantial limitations in treatment options for some bacterial infections. To diminish overall resistance, and especially the occurrence of bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics, certain drugs are deliberately scarcely used—mainly when other options are exhausted. We use a mathematical model to explore the efficiency of such antibiotic restrictions. We assume two commonly used drugs and one restricted drug. The model is examined for the mixing strategy of antibiotic prescription, in which one of the drugs is randomly assigned to each incoming patient. Data obtained from Rabin medical center, Israel, is used to estimate realistic single and double antibiotic resistance frequencies in incoming patients. We find that broad usage of the hitherto restricted drug can reduce the number of incorrectly treated patients, and reduce the spread of bacteria resistant to both common antibiotics. Such double resistant infections are often eventually treated with the restricted drug, and therefore are prone to become resistant to all three antibiotics. Thus, counterintuitively, a broader usage of a formerly restricted drug can sometimes lead to a decrease in the emergence of bacteria resistant to all drugs. We recommend re-examining restriction of specific drugs, when multiple resistance to the relevant alternative drugs already exists.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a global health problem that causes the death of approximately 1.5 million people worldwide each year (WHO, p. 1-126, Global Tuberculosis Report, 2015). Treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis requires combination antimicrobial therapy with a minimum of four antimicrobial agents applied over the course of 6 months. The first instance of combination antimicrobial therapy applied to tuberculosis was the joint use of streptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid as documented by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom in 1950. These antimicrobial drugs were the product of many decades of investigation into both organism-derived antibiotics and synthetic chemotherapy and were the first agents in those respective categories to show substantial clinical efficacy and widespread use for tuberculosis. The events leading to the discovery and application of these two agents demonstrate that investments in all aspects of research, from basic science to clinical application, are necessary for the continued success of science in finding treatments for human disease. This observation is especially worth considering given the expanded role that combination therapy may play in combating the current rise in resistance to antimicrobial drugs.},

abstract = {Hospital-acquired infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave and growing threat to public health. Antimicrobial cycling, in which two or more antibiotic classes are alternated on a time scale of months to years, seems to be a leading candidate in the search for treatment strategies that can slow the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance in hospitals. We develop a mathematical model of antimicrobial cycling in a hospital setting and use this model to explore the efficacy of cycling programs. We find that cycling is unlikely to reduce either the evolution or the spread of antibiotic resistance. Alternative drug-use strategies such as mixing, in which each treated patient receives one of several drug classes used simultaneously in the hospital, are predicted to be more effective. A simple ecological explanation underlies these results. Heterogeneous antibiotic use slows the spread of resistance. However, at the scale relevant to bacterial populations, mixing imposes greater heterogeneity than does cycling. As a consequence, cycling is unlikely to be effective and may even hinder resistance control. These results may explain the limited success reported thus far from clinical trials of antimicrobial cycling.},

abstract = {Combination therapy is rarely used to counter the evolution of resistance in bacterial infections. Expansion of the use of combination therapy requires knowledge of how drugs interact at inhibitory concentrations. More than 50 years ago, it was noted that, if bactericidal drugs are most potent with actively dividing cells, then the inhibition of growth induced by a bacteriostatic drug should result in an overall reduction of efficacy when the drug is used in combination with a bactericidal drug. Our goal here was to investigate this hypothesis systematically. We first constructed time-kill curves using five different antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations, and we observed antagonism between bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs. We extended our investigation by performing a screen of pairwise combinations of 21 different antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations, and we found that strong antagonistic interactions were enriched significantly among combinations of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs. Finally, since our hypothesis relies on phenotypic effects produced by different drug classes, we recreated these experiments in a microfluidic device and performed time-lapse microscopy to directly observe and quantify the growth and division of individual cells with controlled antibiotic concentrations. While our single-cell observations supported the antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs, they revealed an unexpected variety of cellular responses to antagonistic drug combinations, suggesting that multiple mechanisms underlie the interactions.

abstract = {Although both genotypes with elevated mutation rate (mutators) and mobilization of insertion sequence (IS) elements have substantial impact on genome diversification, their potential interactions are unknown. Moreover, the evolutionary forces driving gradual accumulation of these elements are unclear: Do these elements spread in an initially transposon-free bacterial genome as they enable rapid adaptive evolution? To address these issues, we inserted an active IS1 element into a reduced Escherichia coli genome devoid of all other mobile DNA. Evolutionary laboratory experiments revealed that IS elements increase mutational supply and occasionally generate variants with especially large phenotypic effects. However, their impact on adaptive evolution is small compared with mismatch repair mutator alleles, and hence, the latter impede the spread of IS-carrying strains. Given their ubiquity in natural populations, such mutator alleles could limit early phase of IS element evolution in a new bacterial host. More generally, our work demonstrates the existence of an evolutionary conflict between mutation-promoting mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

The zone diameter breakpoints in the EUCAST disk diffusion method are calibrated to the harmonised European MIC breakpoints that are published by EUCAST and are freely available from the EUCAST website (http://www.eucast.org). As with all standardised methods, the described technique must be followed without modification in order to produce reliable results.

abstract = {Background: Whether antibiotic rotation strategies reduce prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in intensive care units (ICUs) has not been accurately established. We aimed to assess whether cycling of antibiotics compared with a mixing strategy (changing antibiotic to an alternative class for each consecutive patient) would reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in European intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: In a cluster-randomised crossover study, we randomly assigned ICUs to use one of three antibiotic groups (third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin–tazobactam, and carbapenems) as preferred empirical treatment during 6-week periods (cycling) or to change preference after every consecutively treated patient (mixing). Computer-based randomisation of intervention and rotated antibiotic sequence was done centrally. Cycling or mixing was applied for 9 months; then, following a washout period, the alternative strategy was implemented. We defined antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria as Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase production or piperacillin–tazobactam resistance, and Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with piperacillin–tazobactam or carbapenem resistance. Data were collected for all admissions during the study. The primary endpoint was average, unit-wide, monthly point prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in respiratory and perineal swabs with adjustment for potential confounders. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01293071. Findings: Eight ICUs (from Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, and Slovenia) were randomly assigned and patients enrolled from June 27, 2011, to Feb 16, 2014. 4069 patients were admitted during the cycling periods in total and 4707 were admitted during the mixing periods. Of these, 745 patients during cycling and 853 patients during mixing were present during the monthly point-prevalence surveys, and were included in the main analysis. Mean prevalence of the composite primary endpoint was 23{\%} (168/745) during cycling and 22{\%} (184/853) during mixing (p=0{\textperiodcentered}64), yielding an adjusted incidence rate ratio during mixing of 1{\textperiodcentered}039 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}837–1{\textperiodcentered}291; p=0{\textperiodcentered}73). There was no difference in all-cause in-ICU mortality between intervention periods. Interpretation: Antibiotic cycling does not reduce the prevalence of carriage of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in patients admitted to the ICU.

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human health around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR on incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific pathogen–drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study presents the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date. Methods: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen–drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. We used predictive statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data. Our approach can be divided into five broad components: number of deaths where infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden based on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the global and regional level. Findings: On the basis of our predictive statistical models, there were an estimated 4{\textperiodcentered}95 million (3{\textperiodcentered}62–6{\textperiodcentered}57) deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1{\textperiodcentered}27 million (95{\%} UI 0{\textperiodcentered}911–1{\textperiodcentered}71) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age death rate attributable to resistance to be highest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 27{\textperiodcentered}3 deaths per 100 000 (20{\textperiodcentered}9–35{\textperiodcentered}3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6{\textperiodcentered}5 deaths (4{\textperiodcentered}3–9{\textperiodcentered}4) per 100 000. Lower respiratory infections accounted for more than 1{\textperiodcentered}5 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019, making it the most burdensome infectious syndrome. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance (Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were responsible for 929 000 (660 000–1 270 000) deaths attributable to AMR and 3{\textperiodcentered}57 million (2{\textperiodcentered}62–4{\textperiodcentered}78) deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One pathogen–drug combination, meticillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six more each caused 50 000–100 000 deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen–drug combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location-specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics. There are serious data gaps in many low-income settings, emphasising the need to expand microbiology laboratory capacity and data collection systems to improve our understanding of this important human health threat.

We use stochastic modeling methods to establish whether the most likely source of rescue is via a plasmid or via the chromosome, and show that contrary to what is assumed plasmids are not necessarily beneficial locations for resistance genes. Competition at the plasmid level of selection is of great importance-the spread of a resistant plasmid in the population can be slowed or entirely stopped by a nonresistant version of the same plasmid.

Following transformation, aliquots of culture are loaded onto sterile beads that are rolled along individual channels of agar media. After the beads traverse the channel, they drop into the exit alley for disposal via an exit pore. The apparatus presented has 12 individual lanes, and the spacing is compatible with a standard 12-channel pipettor. Thus, the unit allows for the rapid plating of 12 individual cultures at a time. For one 96-well block of transformants, this method reduces the labeling and plating effort from 96 culture dishes that are spread individually to eight multichannel plates.

Here, we present an approach to compare the effect of alternative multidrug treatment strategies in vitro using a robotic liquid-handling platform. We use this framework to study resistance evolution and spread implementing epidemiological population dynamics for treatment, transmission, and patient admission and discharge, as may be observed in hospitals. We perform massively parallel experimental evolution over up to 40 d and complement this with a computational model to infer the underlying population-dynamical parameters. We find that in our study, combination therapy outperforms monotherapies, as well as cycling and mixing, in minimizing resistance evolution and maximizing uninfecteds, as long as there is no influx of double resistance into the focal treated community.},

abstract = {Background. The addition of an aminoglycoside to a $\beta$-lactam therapy regimen has been suggested to have a beneficial effect in delaying or preventing the development of antimicrobial resistance. We studied the effect of aminoglycoside/$\beta$-lactam combination therapy versus $\beta$-lactam monotherapy on the emergence of resistance. Methods. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that compared aminoglycoside/$\beta$-lactam combination therapy with $\beta$-lactam monotherapy and that reported data regarding the emergence of resistance (primary outcome) and/or development of superinfection, treatment failure, treatment failure attributable to emergence of resistance, treatment failure attributable to superinfection, all-cause mortality during treatment, and mortality due to infection. Data for this meta-analysis were identified from the PubMed database, Current Contents database, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and references in relevant articles. Results. A total of 8 RCTs were included in the analysis. $\beta$-Lactam monotherapy was not associated with a greater emergence of resistance than was the aminoglycoside/$\beta$-lactam combination (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.47). Actually, $\beta$-lactam monotherapy was associated with fewer superinfections (OR, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.42-0.93) and fewer treatment failures (OR, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.38-1.01). Rates of treatment failure attributable to emergence of resistance (OR, 3.09; 95{\%} CI, 0.75-12.82), treatment failure attributable to superinfection (OR, 0.60; 95{\%} CI, 0.33-1.10), all-cause mortality during treatment (OR, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.40-1.25), and mortality due to infection (OR, 0.74; 95{\%} CI, 0.46-1.21) did not differ significantly between the 2 regimens. Conclusions. Compared with $\beta$-lactam monotherapy, the aminoglycoside/$\beta$-lactam combination was not associated with a beneficial effect on the development of antimicrobial resistance among initially antimicrobial-susceptible isolates. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through mutations or the acquisition of genetic material such as resistance plasmids represents a major public health issue1,2. Persisters are subpopulations of bacteria that survive antibiotics by reversibly adapting their physiology3–10, and can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants11. We investigated whether persisters can also promote the spread of resistance plasmids. In contrast to mutations, the transfer of resistance plasmids requires the co-occurrence of both a donor and a recipient bacterial strain. For our experiments, we chose the facultative intracellular entero-pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli, a common member of the microbiota12. S. Typhimurium forms persisters that survive antibiotic therapy in several host tissues. Here we show that tissue-associated S. Typhimurium persisters represent long-lived reservoirs of plasmid donors or recipients. The formation of reservoirs of S. Typhimurium persisters requires Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and/or SPI-2 in gut-associated tissues, or SPI-2 at systemic sites. The re-seeding of these persister bacteria into the gut lumen enables the co-occurrence of donors with gut-resident recipients, and thereby favours plasmid transfer between various strains of Enterobacteriaceae. We observe up to 99{\%} transconjugants within two to three days of re-seeding. Mathematical modelling shows that rare re-seeding events may suffice for a high frequency of conjugation. Vaccination reduces the formation of reservoirs of persisters after oral infection with S. Typhimurium, as well as subsequent plasmid transfer. We conclude that—even without selection for plasmid-encoded resistance genes—small reservoirs of pathogen persisters can foster the spread of promiscuous resistance plasmids in the gut.},

The problem is exacerbated by antibiotic-resistant strains that delay or impede effective treatment. To ensure successful therapy and to manage antibiotic resistance, treatment protocols that draw on several different antibiotics might be used. This includes the administration of drug cocktails to individual patients (combination therapy) but also the random assignment of drugs to different patients (mixing) and a regular switch in the default drug used in the hospital from drug A to drug B and back (cycling). For more than 20 years, mathematical models have been used to assess the prospects of antibiotic combination therapy, mixing and cycling. But while tendencies in their ranking across studies have emerged, the picture remains surprisingly inconclusive and incomplete. In this article, we review existing modelling studies and demonstrate by means of examples how methodological factors complicate the emergence of a consistent picture. These factors include the choice of the criterion by which the effects of the protocols are compared, the model implementation and its analysis. We thereafter discuss how progress can be made and suggest future modelling directions.},

Combining a beta lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may provide certain advantages over beta lactam monotherapy. Objectives Our objectives were to compare beta lactam monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy in patients with sepsis and to estimate the rate of adverse effects with each treatment regimen, including the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (1966 to 4 November 2013); EMBASE (1980 to November 2013); LILACS (1982 to November 2013); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2013). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors. In our previous review, we searched the databases to July 2004. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta lactam monotherapy versus any combination of a beta lactam with an aminoglycoside for sepsis. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections and adverse events. Two review authors independently collected data. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed-effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible. Main results We included 69 trials that randomly assigned 7863 participants. Twenty-two trials compared the same beta lactam in both study arms, while the remaining trials compared different beta lactams using a broader-spectrum beta lactam in the monotherapy arm. In trials comparing the same beta lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.73 to 1.30) and clinical failure (RR 1.11, 95{\%} CI 0.95 to 1.29). In studies comparing different beta lactams, we observed a trend for benefit with monotherapy for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95{\%} CI 0.71 to 1.01) and a significant advantage for clinical failure (RR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.67 to 0.84).

The seasonal effect of antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance has been poorly quantified because of lack of large-scale, spatially disaggregated time-series data on antibiotic use and resistance.Methods.We used time-series analysis (Box-Jenkins) on US antibiotic usage from IMS Health and on antibiotic resistance from The Surveillance Network from 1999-2007 to estimate the effect of aminopenicillin, fluoroquinolone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline usage on resistance of Escherichia coli to drugs within these classes. We also quantified the effect of fluoroquinolone and macrolide/lincosamide usage on resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to ciprofloxacin and clindamycin (which has a similar mode of action to macrolides), respectively.Results.Prevalence of resistant Escherichia coli was significantly correlated with lagged (by 1 month) antibiotic prescriptions for aminopenicillins (0.22, P =. 03) and fluoroquinolones (0.24, P =. 02), which are highly prescribed, but was uncorrelated to antibiotic classes with lower prescription levels. Fluoroquinolone prescriptions were also significantly correlated with a 1-month lag with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (0.23, P =. 03).Conclusions.Large-scale usage of antibiotics can generate seasonal patterns of resistance that fluctuate on a short time scale with changes in antibiotic retail sales, suggesting that use of antibiotics in the winter could have a significant effect on resistance. In addition, the strong correlation between community use of antibiotics and resistance isolated in the hospital indicates that restrictions imposed at the hospital level are unlikely to be effective unless coordinated with campaigns to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use at the community level. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.},

abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids is a threat to human and animal health. Phylogenies of bacteria and their plasmids contain clues regarding the frequency of plasmid transfer events, as well as the co-evolution of plasmids and their hosts. However, whole genome sequencing data from diverse ecological or clinical bacterial samples are rarely used to study plasmid phylogenies and resistance gene transfer. This is partially due to the difficulty of extracting plasmids from short-read sequencing data. Here, we use both short-and long-read sequencing data of 24 clinical extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli to estimate chromosomal and plasmid phylogenies. We compare the impact of different sequencing and assembly methodologies on these phylogenies and on the inference of horizontal gene transfer. We find that chromosomal phylogenies can be estimated robustly with all methods, whereas plasmid phylogenies have more variable topology and branch lengths across the methods used. Specifically, hybrid methods that use long reads to resolve short-read assemblies (HybridSPAdes and Unicycler) perform better than those that started from long reads during assembly graph generation (Canu). By contrast, the inference of plasmid and antibiotic resistance gene transfer using a parsimony-based criterion is mostly robust to the choice of sequencing and assembly method.

However, there is no standard method to determine the rate at which they spread horizontally via conjugation. Here, we compare commonly used methods on simulated and experimental data, and show that the resulting conjugation rate estimates often depend strongly on the time of measurement, the initial population densities, or the initial ratio of donor to recipient populations. Differences in growth rate, e.g. induced by sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations or temperature, can also significantly bias conjugation rate estimates. We derive a new ‘end-point' measure to estimate conjugation rates, which extends the well-known Simonsen method to include the effects of differences in population growth and conjugation rates from donors and transconjugants. We further derive analytical expressions for the parameter range in which these approximations remain valid. We present an easy to use R package and web interface which implement both new and previously existing methods to estimate conjugation rates. The result is a set of tools and guidelines for accurate and comparable measurement of plasmid conjugation rates.},

E. coli ST131 causes extraintestinal infections and is often fluoroquinolone resistant and associated with extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase production, especially CTX-M-15. K. pneumoniae ST258 causes urinary and respiratory tract infections and is associated with carbapenemases, most often KPC-2 and KPC-3. The most prevalent lineage within ST131 is named fimH30 because it contains the H30 variant of the type 1 fimbrial adhesin gene, and recent molecular studies have demonstrated that this lineage emerged in the early 2000s and was then followed by the rapid expansion of its sublineages H30-R and H30-Rx. K. pneumoniae ST258 comprises 2 distinct lineages, namely clade I and clade II. Moreover, it seems that ST258 is a hybrid clone that was created by a large recombination event between ST11 and ST442. Epidemic plasmids with blaCTX-M and blaKPC belonging to incompatibility group F have contributed significantly to the success of these clones. E. coli ST131 and K. pneumoniae ST258 are the quintessential examples of international multidrug-resistant high-risk clones.},

abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance is attracting increased attention to combination-based treatments. Although drug combinations have been studied extensively for their effects on bacterial growth1–11, much less is known about their effects on bacterial long-term clearance, especially at cidal, clinically relevant concentrations12–14. Here, using en masse microplating and automated image analysis, we systematically quantify Staphylococcus aureus survival during prolonged exposure to pairwise and higher-order cidal drug combinations. By quantifying growth inhibition, early killing and longer-term population clearance by all pairs of 14 antibiotics, we find that clearance interactions are qualitatively different, often showing reciprocal suppression whereby the efficacy of the drug mixture is weaker than any of the individual drugs alone. Furthermore, in contrast to growth inhibition6–10 and early killing, clearance efficacy decreases rather than increases as more drugs are added. However, specific drugs targeting non-growing persisters15–17 circumvent these suppressive effects. Competition experiments show that reciprocal suppressive drug combinations select against resistance to any of the individual drugs, even counteracting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus both in vitro and in a Galleria mellonella larva model. As a consequence, adding a $\beta$-lactamase inhibitor that is commonly used to potentiate treatment against $\beta$-lactam-resistant strains can reduce rather than increase treatment efficacy. Together, these results underscore the importance of systematic mapping the long-term clearance efficacy of drug combinations for designing more-effective, resistance-proof multidrug regimes.},

abstract = {Although caused by vastly different pathogens, the world's three most serious infectious diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV-1 infection, share the common problem of drug resistance. The pace of drug development has been very slow for tuberculosis and malaria and rapid for HIV-1. But for each disease, resistance to most drugs has appeared quickly after the introduction of the drug. Learning how to manage and prevent resistance is a major medical challenge that requires an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of each pathogen. This Review summarizes the similarities and differences in the evolution of drug resistance for these three pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The widespread use of antibiotics results in the generation of antibiotic concentration gradients in humans, livestock and the environment. Thus, bacteria are frequently exposed to non-lethal (that is, subinhibitory) concentrations of drugs, and recent evidence suggests that this is likely to have an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. In this Review, we discuss the ecology of antibiotics and the ability of subinhibitory concentrations to select for bacterial resistance. We also consider the effects of low-level drug exposure on bacterial physiology, including the generation of genetic and phenotypic variability, as well as the ability of antibiotics to function as signalling molecules. Together, these effects accelerate the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria among humans and animals.{\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have been increasingly reported in humans, companion animals and farm animals. The growing trend of plasmid-mediated resistance to antimicrobial classes of critical importance is attributed to the emergence of epidemic plasmids, rapidly disseminating resistance genes among the members of Enterobacteriaceae family. The use of antibiotics to treat humans and animals has had a significant impact on the environment and on wild animals living and feeding in human-influenced habitats. Wildlife can acquire MDR bacteria selected in hospitals, community or livestock from diverse sources, including wastewater, sewage systems, landfills, farm facilities or agriculture fields. Therefore, wild animals are considered indicators of environmental pollution by antibiotic resistant bacteria, but they can also act as reservoirs and vectors spreading antibiotic resistance across the globe. The level of resistance and reported plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms observed in bacteria of wildlife origin seem to correlate well with the situation described in humans and domestic animals. Additionaly, the identification of epidemic plasmids in samples from different human, animal and wildlife sources underlines the role of horizontal gene transfer in the dissemination of resistance genes. The present review focuses on reports of plasmid-mediated resistance to critically important antimicrobial classes such as broad-spectrum beta-lactams and colistin in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from samples of wildlife origin. The role of plasmids in the dissemination of ESBL-, AmpC- and carbapenemase-encoding genes as well as plasmid-mediated colistin resistance determinants in wildlife are discussed, and their similarities to plasmids previously identified in samples of human clinical or livestock origin are highlighted. Furthermore, we present features of completely sequenced plasmids reported from wildlife Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with special focus on genes that could be associated with the plasticity and stable maintenance of these molecules in antibiotic-free environments.},

abstract = {The present approach to modelling the development of insensitivity to fungicides involves 16 independent variables relating to the pathogen and fungicides. Factors included in the model described here ensure that it is more sensitive to dose-activity functions, the degradation of fungicide residues and the logistic function of the fungal growth. The comparison of different strategies against the build-up of resistance is made on the basis of the logarithmic increase of the resistance frequency during one period of treatment. Moreover, the model describes the gradual shift of the average EC50 value of the whole population when the frequency distributions of the sensitivities of sub-populations are overlapping, thus providing an epidemiological approach to the directional selection. Using this model for the choice of the best anti-resistance strategies, additional conclusions can be drawn compared with those from earlier models. Parameters of crucial importance not previously taken into account are the slopes the slopes of the dose-activity functions of the fungicides applied. Delaying the outbreak of resistance either by combined or alternating use of fungicides is more successful when the slope of the dose-activity function of the at-risk fungicide is steep. The delaying effect of mixtures, being more advantageous than that of alternating treatments in most cases, is rendered less effective at low values of the slope of the activity functions of both fungicides. A partner systemic fungicide restricts any increase in resistance frequency to a greater extent than does a contact fungicide, when used in mixtures; however, the reverse is true for alternating treatments. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Dose‐response relationships are a general concept for quantitatively describing biological systems across multiple scales, from the molecular to the whole‐cell level. A clinically relevant example is the bacterial growth response to antibiotics, which is routinely characterized by dose‐response curves. The shape of the dose‐response curve varies drastically between antibiotics and plays a key role for treatments, drug interactions, and resistance evolution. However, the mechanisms shaping the dose‐response curve remain largely unclear. Here, we show in Escherichia coli that the distinctively shallow dose‐response curve of the antibiotic trimethoprim is caused by a negative growth‐ mediated feedback loop: Trimethoprim slows growth, which in turn weakens the effect of this antibiotic. At the molecular level, this feedback is caused by the upregulation of the drug target dihydrofolate reductase (FolA/DHFR). We show that this upregulation is not a specific response to trimethoprim but follows a universal trend line that depends only on growth rate, irrespective of its cause. Rewiring the feedback loop alters the dose‐response curve in a predictable manner, which we corroborate with a mathematical model. Our results indicate that growth‐mediated feedback loops shape drug responses and could be exploited to design evolutionary traps that enable selection against drug resistance.

Here we propose new criteria for the evaluation of the population-wide effects of treatment protocols for directly transmitted bacterial infections and discuss different usage patterns for single and multiple antibiotic therapy. A mathematical model suggests that the long- term benefit of single drug treatment from introduction of the antibiotic until a high frequency of resistance precludes its use is almost independent of the pattern of antibiotic use. When more than one antibiotic is employed, sequential use of different antibiotics in the population ('cycling') is always inferior to treatment strategies where, at any given time, equal fractions of the population receive different antibiotics. However, treatment of all patients with a combination of antibiotics is in most cases the optimal treatment strategy.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that antibiotics can promote horizontal gene transfer. However, because of a variety of confounding factors that complicate the interpretation of previous studies, the mechanisms by which antibiotics modulate horizontal gene transfer remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether antibiotics directly regulate the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer, serve as a selection force to modulate population dynamics after such gene transfer has occurred, or both. Here, we address this question by quantifying conjugation dynamics in the presence and absence of antibiotic-mediated selection. Surprisingly, we find that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics from the most widely used classes do not significantly increase the conjugation efficiency. Instead, our modelling and experimental results demonstrate that conjugation dynamics are dictated by antibiotic-mediated selection, which can both promote and suppress conjugation dynamics. Our findings suggest that the contribution of antibiotics to the promotion of horizontal gene transfer may have been overestimated. These findings have implications for designing effective antibiotic treatment protocols and for assessing the risks of antibiotic use.},

abstract = {Plasmids play an important role in bacterial genome evolution : by transferring genes between lineages. Fitness costs associated with plasmid carriage are expected to be a barrier to gene exchange, but the causes of plasmid fitness costs are poorly understood. Single compensatory mutations are often sufficient to completely ameliorate plasmid fitness costs, suggesting that such costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts rather than generic properties of plasmids, such as their size, metabolic burden, or gene expression level. By combining the results of experimental evolution with genetics and transcriptomics, we show here that fitness costs of 2 divergent large plasmids in Pseudomonas fluorescens are caused by inducing maladaptive expression of a chromosomal tailocin toxin operon. Mutations in single genes unrelated to the toxin operon, and located on either the chromosome or the plasmid, ameliorated the disruption associated with plasmid carriage. We identify one of these compensatory loci, the chromosomal gene PFLU4242, as the key mediator of the fitness costs of both plasmids, with the other compensatory loci either reducing expression of this gene or mitigating its deleterious effects by up-regulating a putative plasmid-borne ParAB operon. The chromosomal mobile genetic element Tn6291, which uses plasmids for transmission, remained up-regulated even in compensated strains, suggesting that mobile genetic elements communicate through pathways independent of general physiological disruption. Plasmid fitness costs caused by specific genetic conflicts are unlikely to act as a long-term barrier to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) due to their propensity for amelioration by single compensatory mutations, helping to explain why plasmids are so common in bacterial genomes.},

abstract = {Plasmids have a key role in bacterial ecology and evolution because they mobilize accessory genes by horizontal gene transfer. However, recent studies have revealed that the evolutionary impact of plasmids goes above and beyond their being mere gene delivery platforms. Plasmids are usually kept at multiple copies per cell, producing islands of polyploidy in the bacterial genome. As a consequence, the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes is governed by a set of rules different from those affecting chromosomal genes, and these rules are shaped by unusual concepts in bacterial genetics, such as genetic dominance, heteroplasmy or segregational drift. In this Review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the importance of plasmids in bacterial ecology and evolution beyond horizontal gene transfer. We focus on new evidence that suggests that plasmids might accelerate bacterial evolution, mainly by promoting the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes, but also by enhancing the adaptation of their host chromosome. Finally, we integrate the most relevant theoretical and empirical studies providing a global understanding of the forces that govern plasmid-mediated evolution in bacteria.},

abstract = {The briefing includes background to the subject of antimicrobial resistance (including commentary from the Review itself and from the World Health Organisation (WHO)), a summary of the recommendations and economic costings in the Review, and brief information on how the UK and the WHO are already looking to combat the issue. The Review (which was commissioned by the Coalition Government in July 2014) describes antimicrobial resistance as " a natural process whereby microbes evolve to be able to resist the action of drugs, making them ineffective " . Over time, this can lead to antibiotics (and other antimicrobials) becoming less effective or, in some cases, ineffective entirely. Although describing it as a " natural phenomenon " , the WHO state that the rate of resistance is accelerated by the overuse or misuse of antibiotics (both in humans and in animals) and by poor infection prevention and control practices. The Review estimated that 700,000 people worldwide a year currently die of resistant infections, and that (if action is not taken) by 2050 this number could rise to around 10 million a year. It also estimated that this would cost around a cumulative {\$}100 trillion in global economic output. Emphasising that the issue needed to be dealt with on a global basis, the Review set out the importance of addressing issues connected to the supply and demand of antimicrobials. The final report of the Review set out ten recommendations to work towards this. Of these, four were highlighted as " particularly important " in the foreword to the report by Lord O'Neill of Gatley, who led the review. These were: a global public awareness campaign to educate people about the issue of drug resistance; introducing market entry rewards for the development of certain successful new drugs; stimulating the market and development of diagnostic technologies to reduce the unnecessary prescription of antimicrobials; and reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture. The Review estimated that its recommendations would cost around {\$}40 billion globally over a decade.},
