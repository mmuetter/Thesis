abstract = {Multiple treatment strategies are available for empiric antibiotic therapy in hospitals, but neither clinical studies nor theoretical investigations have yielded a clear picture when which strategy is optimal and why. Extending earlier work of others and us, we present a mathematical model capturing treatment strategies using two drugs, i.e the multi-drug therapies referred to as cycling, mixing, and combination therapy, as well as monotherapy with either drug. We randomly sample a large parameter space to determine the conditions determining success or failure of these strategies. We find that combination therapy tends to outperform the other treatment strategies. By using linear discriminant analysis and particle swarm optimization, we find that the most important parameters determining success or failure of combination therapy relative to the other treatment strategies are the de novo rate of emergence of double resistance in patients infected with sensitive bacteria and the fitness costs associated with double resistance. The rate at which double resistance is imported into the hospital via patients admitted from the outside community has little influence, as all treatment strategies are affected equally. The parameter sets for which combination therapy fails tend to fall into areas with low biological plausibility as they are characterised by very high rates of de novo emergence of resistance to both drugs compared to a single drug, and the cost of double resistance is considerably smaller than the sum of the costs of single resistance.},

abstract = {Synergistic drug combinations are commonly sought to overcome monotherapy resistance in cancer treatment. To identify such combinations, high-throughput cancer cell line combination screens are performed; and synergy is quantified using competing models based on fundamentally different assumptions. Here, we compare the behaviour of four synergy models, namely Loewe additivity, Bliss independence, highest single agent and zero interaction potency, using the Merck oncology combination screen. We evaluate agreements and disagreements between the models and investigate putative artefacts of each model's assumptions. Despite at least moderate concordance between scores (Pearson's r {\textgreater}0.32, Spearman's $\rho$ {\textgreater} 0.34), multiple instances of strong disagreement were observed. Those disagreements are driven by, among others, large differences in tested concentrations, maximum response values and median effective concentrations.},

abstract = {Combination therapies exploit the chances for better efficacy, decreased toxicity, and reduced development of drug resistance and owing to these advantages, have become a standard for the treatment of several diseases and continue to represent a promising approach in indications of unmet medical need. In this context, studying the effects of a combination of drugs in order to provide evidence of a significant superiority compared to the single agents is of particular interest. Research in this field has resulted in a large number of papers and revealed several issues. Here, we propose an overview of the current methodological landscape concerning the study of combination effects. First, we aim to provide the minimal set of mathematical and pharmacological concepts necessary to understand the most commonly used approaches, divided into effect-based approaches and dose–effect-based approaches, and introduced in light of their respective practical advantages and limitations. Then, we discuss six main common methodological issues that scientists have to face at each step of the development of new combination therapies. In particular, in the absence of a reference methodology suitable for all biomedical situations, the analysis of drug combinations should benefit from a collective, appropriate, and rigorous application of the concepts and methods reviewed here.},

abstract = {The spread of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents calls for population-wide treatment strategies to delay or reverse the trend toward antibiotic resistance. Here we propose new criteria for the evaluation of the population-wide effects of treatment protocols for directly transmitted bacterial infections and discuss different usage patterns for single and multiple antibiotic therapy. A mathematical model suggests that the long- term benefit of single drug treatment from introduction of the antibiotic until a high frequency of resistance precludes its use is almost independent of the pattern of antibiotic use. When more than one antibiotic is employed, sequential use of different antibiotics in the population ('cycling') is always inferior to treatment strategies where, at any given time, equal fractions of the population receive different antibiotics. However, treatment of all patients with a combination of antibiotics is in most cases the optimal treatment strategy.},

@article{Lenhard2015,
abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) often persist despite antibiotic therapy. Against a 10 8-CFU/ml methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (strain COL) population of which 0{\%}, 1{\%}, 10{\%}, 50{\%}, or 100{\%} was an isogenic hemB knockout (Ia48) subpopulation displaying the SCV phenotype, vancomycin achieved maximal reductions of 4.99, 5.39, 4.50, 3.28, and 1.66 log 10 CFU/ml over 48 h. Vancomycin at {\textgreater}16 mg/liter shifted a population from 50{\%} SCV cells at 0 h to 100{\%} SCV cells at 48 h, which was well characterized by a Hill-type model (R 2 {\textgreater} 0.90). S taphylococcus aureus is a virulent pathogen responsible for a myriad of infections ranging from minor community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections to severe nosocomial infections (1). While the current IDSA guidelines recommend vanco-mycin as the primary agent for treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, the utility of the drug has been brought into question due to increasing reports of heterogeneous resistance, treatment failure, and nephrotoxicity (2-4). Despite the global decrease in vancomycin susceptibility, the exact mechanism by which S. aureus develops resistance is not well understood (5). It has been suggested that S. aureus adapts by utilizing an array of genotypic alterations that arise stepwise during the selective pressure of antimicrobial therapy (6, 7). One pathway that S. aureus may exploit during the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is the development of small-colony variants (SCVs) that grow slowly relative to strains of the normal phenotype (NP) (8-10). In vitro testing and macrophage models have confirmed that the SCV phenotype is less susceptible to van-comycin (11, 12). Studies with other antibiotics also suggest that SCV subpopulations may cooperate with NP S. aureus to attenuate antimicrobial activity (13). At present, it is unknown whether SCVs alter vancomycin pharmacodynamics through interactions with NP S. aureus or how the selection of a vancomycin regimen influences the relationship between the two phenotypes. The objective of the current study was, therefore, to utilize reconstructive population biology to determine how the interplay of both phenotypes alters vancomycin pharmacodynamics. The MRSA strain COL (NP) and its isogenic hemB knockout Ia48 (COL hemB::ermB, a stable SCV phenotype) were utilized. The creation of the mutant strain and its features were previously characterized (14). Prior to each experiment, a solution of vanco-mycin was prepared using analytical-grade powder (Sigma Chemical , St. Louis, MO) in the following concentrations: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 mg/liter. Brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with magnesium (12.5 mg/liter) and calcium (25 mg/liter) was used for every experiment. SCV and NP cell suspen-sions were volumetrically titrated to achieve 5 different starting compositions, with a total bacterial load of 10 8 CFU/ml. Two experiments were conducted exclusively investigating the NP or the SCV phenotype (0{\%} SCV/100{\%} NP cells and 100{\%} SCV/0{\%} NP cells), and three mixed populations were investigated with starting inoculums of approximately 1{\%} SCV/99{\%} NP cells, 10{\%} SCV/ 90{\%} NP cells, and 50{\%} SCV/50{\%} NP cells adapted as previously described (30). Time-killing experiments were conducted over 48 h as previously described (11). In mixed-population experiments, bacteria were plated on both plain BHI agar and BHI containing gentamicin (2.0 mg/liter) to select for the SCV phenotype. An integrated pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) approach was utilized as defined previously (11). Using the linear trapezoid rule, the area under the CFU curve in a 48-h time span (AUCFU 0-48) was calculated for each concentration and a growth control. The log ratio area was then calculated as the logarithm of the AUCFU 0-48 of drug divided by the AUCFU 0-48 of the growth control (equation 1). log ratio area log 10 AUCFU drug AUCFU control (1) E E 0 E max (C) H (EC 50) H (C) H (2) A four-parameter concentration-effect Hill-type model was fit to the effect parameter using Systat (version 12; Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) (11). In equation 2, E (dependent variable) represents the log ratio area, E 0 is the effect at a vancomycin concentration of 0, E max is the drug's maximum effect, C is the concentration of vancomycin, EC 50 is the vancomycin concentration displaying 50{\%} of the maximum effect, and H is the sigmoidicity constant. The overall model fits were assessed based on coefficients of determination (R 2).},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of themost pressingpublic health concerns. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of multicellular organisms are considered part of a solution to this problem, and AMPs produced by bacteria such as colistin are last-resort drugs. Importantly, AMPs differ from many antibiotics in their pharmacodynamic characteristics. Here we implement these differences within a theoretical framework to predict the evolution of resistance against AMPs and compare it to antibiotic resistance. Our analysis of resistance evolution finds that pharmacodynamic differences all combine to produce a much lower probability that resistance will evolve against AMPs. The finding can be generalized to all drugswith pharmacodynamics similar to AMPs. Pharmacodynamic concepts are familiar to most practitioners of medical microbiology, and data can be easily obtained for any drug or drug combination. Our theoretical and conceptual framework is, therefore, widely applicable and can help avoid resistance evolution if implemented in antibiotic stewardship schemes or the rational choice of new drug candidates.},

abstract = {Background: The new protease inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs they may be able to cause profound and sustained suppression of HIV replication. Methods: In this double-blind study, 97 HIV- infected patients who had received zidovudine treatment for at least 6 months and had 50 to 400 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and at least 20,000 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for up to 52 weeks: 800 mg of indinavir every eight hours; 200 mg of zidovudine every eight hours combined with 150 mg of lamivudine twice daily; or all three drugs. The patients were followed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events and changes in viral load and CD4 cell counts. Results: The decrease in HIV RNA over the first 24 weeks was greater in the three-drug group than in the other groups (P{\textless}0.001 for each comparison). RNA levels decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter at week 24 in 28 of 31 patients in the three-drug group (90 percent), 12 of 28 patients in the indinavir group (43 percent), and none of 30 patients in the zidovudine- lamivudine group. The increase in CD4 cell counts over the first 24 weeks was greater in the two groups receiving indinavir than in the zidovudine- lamivudine group (P≤0.01 for each comparison). The changes in the viral load and the CD4 cell count persisted for up to 52 weeks. All the regimens were generally well tolerated. Conclusions: In most HIV-infected patients with prior antiretroviral therapy, the combination of indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine reduces levels of HIV RNA to less than 500 copies per milliliter for as long as one year.},

abstract = {Background: Fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including the possible advantage of sexual reproduction, depend critically on the effects of deleterious mutations on fitness. Limited existing experimental evidence suggests that, on average, such effects tend to be aggravated under environmental stresses, consistent with the perception that stress diminishes the organism's ability to tolerate deleterious mutations. Here, we ask whether there are also stresses with the opposite influence, under which the organism becomes more tolerant to mutations. Results: We developed a technique, based on bioluminescence, which allows accurate automated measurements of bacterial growth rates at very low cell densities. Using this system, we measured growth rates of Escherichia coli mutants under a diverse set of environmental stresses. In contrast to the perception that stress always reduces the organism's ability to tolerate mutations, our measurements identified stresses that do the opposite - that is, despite decreasing wild-type growth, they alleviate on average the effect of deleterious mutations. Conclusions: Our results show a qualitative difference between various environmental stresses ranging from alleviation to aggravation of the average effect of mutations. We further show how the existence of stresses that are biased towards alleviation of the effects of mutations may imply the existence of average epistatic interactions between mutations. The results thus offer a connection between the two main factors controlling the effects of deleterious mutations: environmental conditions and epistatic interactions.},

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

The use of this particular strain enables an inducible cell-based bioluminescent assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) of antimicrobial agents, which shows a pronounced detection of compounds targeting transcriptional and translational events in protein synthesis. The optimizations in 96-well format led to several improvements in assay conditions, such as reduction of the pre-incubation time before luminescence induction by half. The threshold for DMSO tolerability was concluded to be up to 1{\%}. Assay protocol was further miniaturized into 384- well format and the liquid handling was automated using a robotic workstation. The use of compound pre-plating into 384-well plates as a part of the process was evaluated, and the total assay volume was further downscaled from 50 $\mu$l to 30 $\mu$l. With this approach, the amount of test compound needed per well was reduced to nanoliter volumes. Using the miniaturized protocol a pilot screen of 2000 known drugs and bioactives was performed. The assay performance was evaluated by calculating known assay quality parameters, the Z′ factor having a mean value of 0.8 during the compound library screening indicated an excellent performance. Of the assay positives, 54 compounds showed high inhibitions (60-100{\%}), of which the majority (89{\%}) were known antibacterial agents. Of the actives showing {\textgreater}60{\%} inhibition, 16 compounds were identified as known transcriptional and translational inhibitors. The screening results demonstrated that the miniaturized assay is well suited for identification of antimicrobial compounds in HT screening, and that the assay is specifically sensitive towards bacterial transcription and translation inhibitors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A dilutional culture in vitro pharmacodynamic model of infection was used to assess the best measure of antibacterial effect for moxifloxacin at simulated human doses of 400 mg 24 hourly for 48 h. This was then related to two pharmacodynamic parameters, the drug area under curve: MIC ratio (AUC/MIC) and the length of time that the drug concentration remained above the MIC of the bacterium (T {\textgreater} MIC). Twenty-one bacterial strains (Streptococcus pneumoniae n = 6; Haemophilus influenzae n = 6; Moraxella catarrhalis n = 3; $\beta$-haemolytic streptococci n = 3; Staphylococcus aureus n = 3; MIC range 0.06-3.6 mg/L) were tested in 69 individual simulations. The measures or parameters of antibacterial effect considered were log change in viable count in the initial inoculum at 12 h ($\Delta$12), 24 h ($\Delta$24), 36 h ($\Delta$36), 48 h ($\Delta$48), maximum reduction in count ($\Delta$(max)); time for bacterial counts to reduce by 100-fold from the initial density (T99) or 1,000-fold (T99.9); and area under the bacterial kill curve from 0 to 24 h (AUBKC24) or from 0 to 48 h (AUBKC48). $\Delta$12, $\Delta$24, $\Delta$36, $\Delta$48, $\Delta$(max), T99, T99.9 did not vary over the complete range of MICs; at high MICs, especially with Gram-positive bacteria the T99 and T99.9 values were {\textgreater}48 h while at low MICs, especially with Gram-negative bacteria, bacterial counts were reduced below the limit of detection with $\Delta$12, $\Delta$24, $\Delta$36, $\Delta$48 and $\Delta$(max) exceeding {\textgreater}6.5 log reduction. AUBKC24 and AUBKC48 varied more completely over the range of MICs and more importantly had the best within-strain reproducibility (median percentage coefficient of variation {\textless}15{\%}). The relationship between the transformed AUBKC24 and AUC/MIC could be described by a sigmoid E(max) model but the relationship with T{\textgreater}MIC could not. Use of weighted least squares regression to examine the combined effect of AUC/MIC and T{\textgreater} MIC on AUBKC24 indicated that AUC/MIC provided a good fit to the data (r2 = 0.94) and adding T{\textgreater}MIC did not improve the model fit. Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that AUC/MIC was predictive of T99 and in a multivariate model although AUC/MIC predicted outcome after fitting AUC/MIC, T{\textgreater} MIC was not significant. AUBKC was thus shown to be the optimum measure of antibacterial effect to use in pharmacodynamic studies of moxifloxacin and AUC/MIC the best predictor of antibacterial effect as measured by AUBKC24 or T99. These results are in good agreement with with animal data on moxifloxacin pharmacodynamics and human data for some other fluoroquinolones.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ancient and conserved across the tree of life. Their efficacy over evolutionary time has been largely attributed to their mechanisms of killing. Yet, the understanding of their pharmacodynamics both in vivo and in vitro is very limited. This is, however, crucial for applications of AMPs as drugs and also informs the understanding of the action of AMPs in natural immune systems. Here, we selected six different AMPs from different organisms to test their individual and combined effects in vitro. We analyzed their pharmacodynamics based on the Hill function and evaluated the interaction of combinations of two and three AMPs. Interactions of AMPs in our study were mostly synergistic, and three-AMP combinations displayed stronger synergism than two-AMP combinations. This suggests synergism to be a common phenomenon in AMP interaction. Additionally, AMPs displayed a sharp increase in killing within a narrow dose range, contrasting with those of antibiotics. We suggest that our results could lead a way toward better evaluation of AMP application in practice and shed some light on the evolutionary consequences of antimicrobial peptide interactions within the immune system of organisms.},

abstract = {Triple antifungal combinations are used against refractory invasive aspergillosis without an adequate understanding of their pharmacodynamic interactions. We initially studied the in vitro triple combination of voriconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin against Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. terreus by a spectrophotometry microdilution broth method after 48 h of incubation. We then analyzed these results with a recently described nonlinear mixture response surface Emax-based model modified to assess pharmacodynamic interactions at various growth levels. The new model allows flexibility in all four parameters of the Emax model and is able to describe complex pharmacodynamic interactions. Concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic interactions were found within the triple antifungal combination. At the 50{\%} growth level, synergy (median interaction indices of 0.43 to 0.82) was observed at low concentrations of voriconazole ({\textless}0.03 mg/liter) and amphotericin B (≤0.20 mg/liter) and at intermediate concentrations of caspofungin (0.95 to 14.88 mg/liter), whereas antagonism (median interaction indices of 1.17 to 1.80) was found at higher concentrations of voriconazole and amphotericin B. Ternary plot and interaction surface analysis further revealed the complexity of these concentration-dependent interactions. With increasing concentrations of amphotericin B, the synergistic interactions of voriconazole-caspofungin double combination decreased while the antagonistic interactions increased. A similar effect was observed when voriconazole was added to the double combination of amphotericin B and caspofungin. In conclusion, the new nonlinear mixture-amount response surface modeling of the triple antifungal combination demonstrated a net antagonism or synergy against Aspergillus species depending upon drug concentrations and species.},

abstract = {Bacteria can be dead, alive, or exhibit slowed or suspended life forms, making bacterial death difficult to establish. Here, agar-plating, microscopic-counting, SYTO9/propidium-iodide staining, MTT-conversion, and bioluminescence-imaging were used to determine bacterial death upon exposure to different conditions. Rank correlations between pairs of assay outcomes were low, indicating different assays measure different aspects of bacterial death. Principal-component analysis yielded two principal components, named “reproductive-ability” (PC1) and “metabolic-activity” (PC2). Plotting of these principal components in two-dimensional space revealed a dead region, with borders defined by the PC1 and PC2 values. Sensu stricto implies an unpractical reality that all assays determining PC1 and PC2 must be carried out in order to establish bacterial death. Considering this unpracticality, it is suggested that at least one assay determining reproductive activity (PC1) and one assay determining metabolic activity (PC2) should be used to establish bacterial death. Minimally, researchers should specifically describe which dimension of bacterial death is assessed, when addressing bacterial death.},

abstract = {Background: The increasing global prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is forcing clinicians to prescribe combination antibiotic regimens to treat serious infections. Currently, the joint activity of a combination is quantified by comparing the observed and expected effects using a reference model. These reference models make different assumptions and interpretations of synergy. They fail to: (i) account for multiple bacterial subpopulations with differing susceptibilities; (ii) quantify or interpret the explicit interaction (synergy/antagonism) mechanisms; and (iii) accommodate spontaneous mutations. Aims: To develop better study designs, mathematical models, metrics and pharmacodynamic analyses to assist with the identification of highly active combinations that are translatable to the clinical context to address the mounting antibiotic resistance threat. Sources: PubMed, references of identified studies and reviews, and personal experience when evidence was lacking. Content: We reviewed metrics and approaches for quantifying the joint activity of the combination. The first example is using experimental data from an in vitro checkerboard synergy panel to develop and illustrate a less model-dependent method for assessing combination regimens. In the second example a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed using mechanism-based mathematical modelling and monotherapy and combination therapy data obtained from an in vitro hollow fibre infection model evaluating linezolid and rifampin regimens against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Implications: Mechanism-based mathematical approach provides an excellent platform for describing the time course of effect while taking into account the mechanisms of different antibiotics and differing pathogen susceptibilities. This approach allows for the future integration of ‘omics' data describing host–pathogen interactions, that will provide a systems-level understanding of the underlying infectious process, and enable the design of effective combination therapies.},

abstract = {Antibiotics that interfere with translation, when combined, interact in diverse and difficult-to-predict ways. Here, we explain these interactions by “translation bottlenecks”: points in the translation cycle where antibiotics block ribosomal progression. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions between translation inhibitors, we generate translation bottlenecks genetically using inducible control of translation factors that regulate well-defined translation cycle steps. These perturbations accurately mimic antibiotic action and drug interactions, supporting that the interplay of different translation bottlenecks causes these interactions. We further show that growth laws, combined with drug uptake and binding kinetics, enable the direct prediction of a large fraction of observed interactions, yet fail to predict suppression. However, varying two translation bottlenecks simultaneously supports that dense traffic of ribosomes and competition for translation factors account for the previously unexplained suppression. These results highlight the importance of “continuous epistasis” in bacterial physiology.},

abstract = {Current cancer therapy includes a variety of strategies that can comprise only one type of treatment or a combination of multiple treatments. Chemotherapy is still the gold standard for cancer therapy, though sometimes associated with undesired side effects and the development of drug resistance. For this reason, drug combination is an approach that has been proposed to overcome the problems related to monotherapy and several studies have already demonstrated the superiority of combined therapies compared to monotherapy. The main goal when designing and evaluating drug combinations is to achieve synergistic effects by demonstrating that the combined effects are greatly superior to the expected from the additive effects of the single drugs, allowing for dosage reduction and therefore decreasing toxicity. Nevertheless, synergism quantification is not a simple task due to the different definitions of additivity and over the years several reference models have been proposed based on different assumptions and with different mathematical frameworks. In this review, we begin to cover the available treatment options for cancer therapy, with emphasis on the importance of drug combinations in cancer therapy. We next describe the classical reference models that have been proposed for synergism evaluation, usually classified as effect-based and dose-effect based methods, with a brief analysis of the current limitations of these models. We also describe here the novel methods for the accurate quantification of drug interactions in combined treatments. At the end of this manuscript, we covered some of the most recent preclinical and clinical combination studies that reflect the importance of the appropriate, accurate and precise application of the concepts and methodologies here described for the evaluation of synergism.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an important global health challenge in the 21st century. A previous study has quantified the global and regional burden of AMR for 2019, followed with additional publications that provided more detailed estimates for several WHO regions by country. To date, there have been no studies that produce comprehensive estimates of AMR burden across locations that encompass historical trends and future forecasts. Methods: We estimated all-age and age-specific deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 22 pathogens, 84 pathogen–drug combinations, and 11 infectious syndromes in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We collected and used multiple cause of death data, hospital discharge data, microbiology data, literature studies, single drug resistance profiles, pharmaceutical sales, antibiotic use surveys, mortality surveillance, linkage data, outpatient and inpatient insurance claims data, and previously published data, covering 520 million individual records or isolates and 19 513 study-location-years. We used statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including those with no data. Our approach leverages the estimation of five broad component quantities: the number of deaths involving sepsis; the proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome; the proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen; the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest; and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden attributable to and associated with AMR, which we define based on two counterfactuals; respectively, an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections are replaced by drug-susceptible infections, and an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection. Additionally, we produced global and regional forecasts of AMR burden until 2050 for three scenarios: a reference scenario that is a probabilistic forecast of the most likely future; a Gram-negative drug scenario that assumes future drug development that targets Gram-negative pathogens; and a better care scenario that assumes future improvements in health-care quality and access to appropriate antimicrobials. We present final estimates aggregated to the global, super-regional, and regional level. Findings: In 2021, we estimated 4{\textperiodcentered}71 million (95{\%} UI 4{\textperiodcentered}23–5{\textperiodcentered}19) deaths were associated with bacterial AMR, including 1{\textperiodcentered}14 million (1{\textperiodcentered}00–1{\textperiodcentered}28) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. Trends in AMR mortality over the past 31 years varied substantially by age and location. From 1990 to 2021, deaths from AMR decreased by more than 50{\%} among children younger than 5 years yet increased by over 80{\%} for adults 70 years and older. AMR mortality decreased for children younger than 5 years in all super-regions, whereas AMR mortality in people 5 years and older increased in all super-regions. For both deaths associated with and deaths attributable to AMR, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased the most globally (from 261 000 associated deaths [95{\%} UI 150 000–372 000] and 57 200 attributable deaths [34 100–80 300] in 1990, to 550 000 associated deaths [500 000–600 000] and 130 000 attributable deaths [113 000–146 000] in 2021). Among Gram-negative bacteria, resistance to carbapenems increased more than any other antibiotic class, rising from 619 000 associated deaths (405 000–834 000) in 1990, to 1{\textperiodcentered}03 million associated deaths (909 000–1{\textperiodcentered}16 million) in 2021, and from 127 000 attributable deaths (82 100–171 000) in 1990, to 216 000 (168 000–264 000) attributable deaths in 2021. There was a notable decrease in non-COVID-related infectious disease in 2020 and 2021. Our forecasts show that an estimated 1{\textperiodcentered}91 million (1{\textperiodcentered}56–2{\textperiodcentered}26) deaths attributable to AMR and 8{\textperiodcentered}22 million (6{\textperiodcentered}85–9{\textperiodcentered}65) deaths associated with AMR could occur globally in 2050. Super-regions with the highest all-age AMR mortality rate in 2050 are forecasted to be south Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Increases in deaths attributable to AMR will be largest among those 70 years and older (65{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} [61{\textperiodcentered}2–69{\textperiodcentered}8] of all-age deaths attributable to AMR in 2050). In stark contrast to the strong increase in number of deaths due to AMR of 69{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (51{\textperiodcentered}5–89{\textperiodcentered}2) from 2022 to 2050, the number of DALYs showed a much smaller increase of 9{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (–6{\textperiodcentered}9 to 29{\textperiodcentered}0) to 46{\textperiodcentered}5 million (37{\textperiodcentered}7 to 57{\textperiodcentered}3) in 2050. Under the better care scenario, across all age groups, 92{\textperiodcentered}0 million deaths (82{\textperiodcentered}8–102{\textperiodcentered}0) could be cumulatively averted between 2025 and 2050, through better care of severe infections and improved access to antibiotics, and under the Gram-negative drug scenario, 11{\textperiodcentered}1 million AMR deaths (9{\textperiodcentered}08–13{\textperiodcentered}2) could be averted through the development of a Gram-negative drug pipeline to prevent AMR deaths. Interpretation: This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR from 1990 to 2021, with results forecasted until 2050. Evaluating changing trends in AMR mortality across time and location is necessary to understand how this important global health threat is developing and prepares us to make informed decisions regarding interventions. Our findings show the importance of infection prevention, as shown by the reduction of AMR deaths in those younger than 5 years. Simultaneously, our results underscore the concerning trend of AMR burden among those older than 70 years, alongside a rapidly ageing global community. The opposing trends in the burden of AMR deaths between younger and older individuals explains the moderate future increase in global number of DALYs versus number of deaths. Given the high variability of AMR burden by location and age, it is important that interventions combine infection prevention, vaccination, minimisation of inappropriate antibiotic use in farming and humans, and research into new antibiotics to mitigate the number of AMR deaths that are forecasted for 2050.

abstract = {Multidrug treatments are increasingly important in medicine and for probing biological systems1-6. Although many studies have focused on interactions between specific drugs, little is known about the system properties of a full drug interaction network6. Like their genetic counterparts, two drugs may have no interaction, or they may interact synergistically or antagonistically to increase or suppress their individual effects. Here we use a sensitive bioluminescence technique7,8 to provide quantitative measurements of pairwise interactions among 21 antibiotics that affect growth rate in Escherichia coli. We find that the drug interaction network possesses a special property: it can be separated into classes of drugs such that any two classes interact either purely synergistically or purely antagonistically. These classes correspond directly to the cellular functions affected by the drugs. This network approach provides a new conceptual framework for understanding the functional mechanisms of drugs and their cellular targets and can be applied in systems intractable to mutant screening, biochemistry or microscopy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {There is a complex quantitative relationship between the concentrations of antibiotics and the growth and death rates of bacteria. Despite this complexity, in most cases only a single pharmacodynamic parameter, the MIC of the drug, is employed for the rational development of antibiotic treatment regimens. In this report, we use a mathematical model based on a Hill function - which we call the pharmacodynamic function and which is related to previously published E max models - to describe the relationship between the bacterial net growth rates and the concentrations of antibiotics of five different classes: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and rifampin. Using Escherichia coli O18:K1:H7, we illustrate how precise estimates of the four parameters of the pharmacodynamic function can be obtained from in vitro time-kill data. We show that, in addition to their respective MICs, these antibiotics differ in the values of the other pharmacodynamic parameters. Using a computer simulation of antibiotic treatment in vivo, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of differences in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as the steepness of the Hill function and the minimum bacterial net growth rate attained at high antibiotic concentrations, there can be profound differences in the microbiological efficacy of antibiotics with identical MICs. We discuss the clinical implications and limitations of these results.},

abstract = {From natural ecology1–4 to clinical therapy5–8, cells are often exposed to mixtures of multiple drugs. Two competing null models are used to predict the combined effect of drugs: response additivity (Bliss) and dosage additivity (Loewe)9–11. Here, noting that these models diverge with increased number of drugs, we contrast their predictions with growth measurements of four phylogenetically distant microorganisms including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under combinations of up to ten different drugs. In all species, as the number of drugs increases, Bliss maintains accuracy while Loewe systematically loses its predictive power. The total dosage required for growth inhibition, which Loewe predicts should be fixed, steadily increases with the number of drugs, following a square-root scaling. This scaling is explained by an approximation to Bliss where, inspired by R. A. Fisher's classical geometric model12, dosages of independent drugs add up as orthogonal vectors rather than linearly. This dose-orthogonality approximation provides results similar to Bliss, yet uses the dosage language as in Loewe and is hence easier to implement and intuit. The rejection of dosage additivity in favour of effect additivity and dosage orthogonality provides a framework for understanding how multiple drugs and stressors add up in nature and the clinic.},

abstract = {The dynamics of bacterial population decline at antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) remain poorly characterized. This is because measuring colony-forming units (CFU), the standard assay to quantify inhibition, is slow, labour-intensive, costly, and can be unreliable at high drug concentrations. Luminescence assays are widely used to quantify population dynamics at subinhibitory concentrations, yet their limitations and reliability at super-MIC concentrations remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we compared luminescence- and CFU-based rates across 20 antimicrobials. In our experiments luminescence- and CFU-based rates did not differ significantly for half of them. For the other half, CFU-based estimates of rates of decline were consistently higher. The estimates differed for two main reasons: First, because light intensity tracks biomass more closely than population size, luminescence declined more slowly than the population when bacteria filamented. Second, CFU-based estimates indicated a steeper decline when antimicrobial treatment reduced the number of colonies formed per plated bacterium. This effect can result from changes in clustering behaviour, physiological changes that impair culturability, or antimicrobial carry-over. Thus, the suitability of luminescence to quantify bacterial decline depends on the physiological effects of the antimicrobial used (e.g. filamentation) and whether the quantity of interest is cell number or biomass. Within these limitations, luminescence can serve as an efficient, high-throughput alternative for quantifying bacterial dynamics at super-MIC concentrations.},

abstract = {Dose‐response relationships are a general concept for quantitatively describing biological systems across multiple scales, from the molecular to the whole‐cell level. A clinically relevant example is the bacterial growth response to antibiotics, which is routinely characterized by dose‐response curves. The shape of the dose‐response curve varies drastically between antibiotics and plays a key role for treatments, drug interactions, and resistance evolution. However, the mechanisms shaping the dose‐response curve remain largely unclear. Here, we show in Escherichia coli that the distinctively shallow dose‐response curve of the antibiotic trimethoprim is caused by a negative growth‐ mediated feedback loop: Trimethoprim slows growth, which in turn weakens the effect of this antibiotic. At the molecular level, this feedback is caused by the upregulation of the drug target dihydrofolate reductase (FolA/DHFR). We show that this upregulation is not a specific response to trimethoprim but follows a universal trend line that depends only on growth rate, irrespective of its cause. Rewiring the feedback loop alters the dose‐response curve in a predictable manner, which we corroborate with a mathematical model. Our results indicate that growth‐mediated feedback loops shape drug responses and could be exploited to design evolutionary traps that enable selection against drug resistance.

abstract = {In combination therapy, bacteria are challenged with two or more antibiotics simultaneously. Ideally, separate mutations are required to adapt to each of them, which is a priori expected to hinder the evolution of full resistance. Yet, the success of this strategy ultimately depends on how well the combination controls the growth of bacteria with and without resistance mutations. To design a combination treatment, we need to choose drugs and their doses and decide how many drugs get mixed. Which combinations are good? To answer this question, we set up a stochastic pharmacodynamic model and determine the probability to successfully eradicate a bacterial population. We consider bacteriostatic and two types of bactericidal drugs—those that kill independent of replication and those that kill during replication. To establish results for a null model, we consider non-interacting drugs and implement the two most common models for drug independence—Loewe additivity and Bliss independence. Our results show that combination therapy is almost always better in limiting the evolution of resistance than administering just one drug, even though we keep the total drug dose constant for a ‘fair' comparison. Yet, exceptions exist for drugs with steep dose–response curves. Combining a bacteriostatic and a bactericidal drug which can kill non-replicating cells is particularly beneficial. Our results suggest that a 50:50 drug ratio—even if not always optimal—is usually a good and safe choice. Applying three or four drugs is beneficial for treatment of strains with large mutation rates but adding more drugs otherwise only provides a marginal benefit or even a disadvantage. By systematically addressing key elements of treatment design, our study provides a basis for future models which take further factors into account. It also highlights conceptual challenges with translating the traditional concepts of drug independence to the single-cell level.},

C-T alone resulted in 24-h changes in the number of CFU of -0.02 ±0.21, -1.81 ±0.55, -1.44 ±0.40, and +0.62 ±0.05 log10 CFU/ml against isolates with C-T MICs of 4, 4, 8, and 16 g/ml, respectively. Amikacin and colistin monotherapy displayed various results. The addition of amikacin to C-T resulted in -2.00 ±0.23 (P {\textless}0.001, additive)-1.50 ±0.83 (P {\textless}0.687, indifferent)-, 2.84 ±0.08 (P {\textless}0.079, indifferent)and -2.67 0.54 (P {\textless}0.001, synergy)-log10 CFU/ml reductions, respectively. The addition of colistin to C-T resulted in -3.02 ±0.22 (P {\textless}0.001, additive)-3.21 ±0.24 (P {\textless}0.05, indifferent)-4.6 ±0.11 (P {\textless}0.002, synergy)-, and -3.01 ±0.28 (P {\textless}0.001, synergy)log10 CFU/ml reductions, respectively, against the MDR P. aeruginosa isolates with these MICs. Greater overall reductions in bacterial burden, including additive or synergistic interactions at 24 h, with C-T plus amikacin or colistin were observed against 3 out of 4 MDR P. aeruginosa strains tested, particularly those strains that were intermediate or resistant to C-T. Further studies assessing combination regimens containing C-T against MDR P. aeruginosa are warranted.},

abstract = {Two goals motivate treating diseases with drug combinations: reduce off-target toxicity by minimizing doses (synergistic potency) and improve outcomes by escalating effect (synergistic efficacy). Established drug synergy frameworks obscure such distinction, failing to harness the potential of modern chemical libraries. We therefore developed multi-dimensional synergy of combinations (MuSyC), a formalism based on a generalized, multi-dimensional Hill equation, which decouples synergistic potency and efficacy. In mutant-EGFR-driven lung cancer, MuSyC reveals that combining a mutant-EGFR inhibitor with inhibitors of other kinases may result only in synergistic potency, whereas synergistic efficacy can be achieved by co-targeting mutant-EGFR and epigenetic regulation or microtubule polymerization. In mutant-BRAF melanoma, MuSyC determines whether a molecular correlate of BRAFi insensitivity alters a BRAF inhibitor's potency, efficacy, or both. These findings showcase MuSyC's potential to transform the enterprise of drug-combination screens by precisely guiding translation of combinations toward dose reduction, improved efficacy, or both. Meyer et al. developed a framework for measuring drug combination synergy. The framework, termed MuSyC, distinguishes between two types of synergy. The first quantifies the change in the maximal effect with the combination (synergistic efficacy), and the second measures the change in a drug's potency due to the combination (synergistic potency). By decoupling these two synergies conflated in prior methods, MuSyC rationally guides discovery and translation of drug combinations for the improvement of therapeutic efficacy and reduction of off-target toxicities via dose reduction.},

abstract = {The emergence of drug resistant pathogens is a serious public health problem. It is a long-standing goal to predict rates of resistance evolution and design optimal treatment strategies accordingly. To this end, it is crucial to reveal the underlying causes of drug-specific differences in the evolutionary dynamics leading to resistance. However, it remains largely unknown why the rates of resistance evolution via spontaneous mutations and the diversity of mutational paths vary substantially between drugs. Here we comprehensively quantify the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, a key determinant of evolutionary dynamics, in the presence of eight antibiotics representing the main modes of action. Using precise high-throughput fitness measurements for genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains, we find that the width of the DFE varies dramatically between antibiotics and, contrary to conventional wisdom, for some drugs the DFE width is lower than in the absence of stress. We show that this previously underappreciated divergence in DFE width among antibiotics is largely caused by their distinct drug-specific dose-response characteristics. Unlike the DFE, the magnitude of the changes in tolerated drug concentration resulting from genome-wide mutations is similar for most drugs but exceptionally small for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin, i.e., mutations generally have considerably smaller resistance effects for nitrofurantoin than for other drugs. A population genetics model predicts that resistance evolution for drugs with this property is severely limited and confined to reproducible mutational paths. We tested this prediction in laboratory evolution experiments using the “morbidostat”, a device for evolving bacteria in well-controlled drug environments. Nitrofurantoin resistance indeed evolved extremely slowly via reproducible mutations—an almost paradoxical behavior since this drug causes DNA damage and increases the mutation rate. Overall, we identified novel quantitative characteristics of the evolutionary landscape that provide the conceptual foundation for predicting the dynamics of drug resistance evolution.},

abstract = {Combination therapy is rarely used to counter the evolution of resistance in bacterial infections. Expansion of the use of combination therapy requires knowledge of how drugs interact at inhibitory concentrations. More than 50 years ago, it was noted that, if bactericidal drugs are most potent with actively dividing cells, then the inhibition of growth induced by a bacteriostatic drug should result in an overall reduction of efficacy when the drug is used in combination with a bactericidal drug. Our goal here was to investigate this hypothesis systematically. We first constructed time-kill curves using five different antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations, and we observed antagonism between bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs. We extended our investigation by performing a screen of pairwise combinations of 21 different antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations, and we found that strong antagonistic interactions were enriched significantly among combinations of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs. Finally, since our hypothesis relies on phenotypic effects produced by different drug classes, we recreated these experiments in a microfluidic device and performed time-lapse microscopy to directly observe and quantify the growth and division of individual cells with controlled antibiotic concentrations. While our single-cell observations supported the antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs, they revealed an unexpected variety of cellular responses to antagonistic drug combinations, suggesting that multiple mechanisms underlie the interactions.

abstract = {Drug combinations are increasingly important in disease treatments, for combating drug resistance, and for elucidating fundamental relationships in cell physiology. When drugs are combined, their individual effects on cells may be amplified or weakened. Such drug interactions are crucial for treatment efficacy, but their underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. To uncover the causes of drug interactions, we developed a systematic approach based on precise quantification of the individual and joint effects of antibiotics on growth of genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains. We found that drug interactions between antibiotics representing the main modes of action are highly robust to genetic perturbation. This robustness is encapsulated in a general principle of bacterial growth, which enables the quantitative prediction of mutant growth rates under drug combinations. Rare violations of this principle exposed recurring cellular functions controlling drug interactions. In particular, we found that polysaccharide and ATP synthesis control multiple drug interactions with previously unexplained mechanisms, and small molecule adjuvants targeting these functions synthetically reshape drug interactions in predictable ways. These results provide a new conceptual framework for the design of multidrug combinations and suggest that there are universal mechanisms at the heart of most drug interactions.},

@article{Chou1984,
abstract = {A generalized method for analyzing the effects of multiple drugs and for determining summation, synergism and antagonism has been proposed. The derived, generalized equations are based on kinetic principles. The method is relatively simple and is not limited by 1) whether the dose-effect relationships are hyperbolic or sigmoidal, 2) whether the effects of the drugs are mutually exclusive or nonexclusive, 3) whether the ligand interactions are competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive, 4) whether the drugs are agonists or antagonists, or 5) the number of drugs involved. The equations for the two most widely used methods for analyzing synergism, antagonism and summation of effects of multiple drugs, the isobologram and fractional product concepts, have been derived and been shown to have limitations in their applications. These two methods cannot be used indiscriminately. The equations underlying these two methods can be derived from a more generalized equation previously developed by us (59). it can be shown that the isobologram is valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the isobol method, it is laborious to find proper combinations of drugs that would produce an iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method tends to give indication of synergism, since it understimates the summation of the effect of mutually nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect curves. The method described herein is devoid of these deficiencies and limitations. The simplified experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect analysis has the following advantages: 1) It provides a simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot) for evaluating the applicability of the data, and provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain a general equation for the dose-effect relation; 2) the analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and linear regression can be readily carried out with a simple programmable electronic calculator and does not require special graph paper or tables; and 3) the simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of application and the use of a minimum number of data points. This method has been used to analyze experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and animal systems. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The dynamics of bacterial population decline at antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) remain poorly characterized. This is because measuring colony-forming units (CFU), the standard assay to quantify inhibition, is slow, labour-intensive, costly, and can be unreliable at high drug concentrations. Luminescence assays are widely used to quantify population dynamics at subinhibitory concentrations, yet their limitations and reliability at super-MIC concentrations remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we compared luminescence- and CFU-based rates across 20 antimicrobials. In our experiments luminescence- and CFU-based rates did not differ significantly for half of them. For the other half, CFU-based estimates of rates of decline were consistently higher. The estimates differed for two main reasons: First, because light intensity tracks biomass more closely than population size, luminescence declined more slowly than the population when bacteria filamented. Second, CFU-based estimates indicated a steeper decline when antimicrobial treatment reduced the number of colonies formed per plated bacterium. This effect can result from changes in clustering behaviour, physiological changes that impair culturability, or antimicrobial carry-over. Thus, the suitability of luminescence to quantify bacterial decline depends on the physiological effects of the antimicrobial used (e.g. filamentation) and whether the quantity of interest is cell number or biomass. Within these limitations, luminescence can serve as an efficient, high-throughput alternative for quantifying bacterial dynamics at super-MIC concentrations.

abstract = {Drug combinations are a promising approach to achieve high efficacy at low doses and to overcome resistance. Drug combinations are especially useful when drugs cannot achieve effectiveness at tolerable doses, as occurs in cancer and tuberculosis (TB). However, discovery of effective drug combinations faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion, in which the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of drugs and doses. A recent advance, called the dose model, uses a mathematical formula to overcome combinatorial explosion by reducing the problem to a feasible quadratic one: using data on drug pairs at a few doses, the dose model accurately predicts the effect of combinations of three and four drugs at all doses. The dose model has not yet been tested on higher-order combinations beyond four drugs. To address this, we measured the effect of combinations of up to ten antibiotics on E. coli growth, and of up to five tuberculosis (TB) drugs on the growth of M. tuberculosis. We find that the dose model accurately predicts the effect of these higher-order combinations, including cases of strong synergy and antagonism. This study supports the view that the interactions between drug pairs carries key information that largely determines higher-order interactions. Therefore, systematic study of pairwise drug interactions is a compelling strategy to prioritize drug regimens in high-dimensional spaces.},

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics. We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials' risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. 42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95{\%} CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77{\%}). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions. The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.},

abstract = {The rapid rise of antibiotic resistance, combined with the increasing cost and difficulties to develop new antibiotics, calls for treatment strategies that enable more sustainable antibiotic use. The development of such strategies, however, is impeded by the lack of suitable experimental approaches that allow testing their effects under realistic epidemiological conditions. Here, we present an approach to compare the effect of alternative multidrug treatment strategies in vitro using a robotic liquid-handling platform. We use this framework to study resistance evolution and spread implementing epidemiological population dynamics for treatment, transmission, and patient admission and discharge, as may be observed in hospitals. We perform massively parallel experimental evolution over up to 40 d and complement this with a computational model to infer the underlying population-dynamical parameters. We find that in our study, combination therapy outperforms monotherapies, as well as cycling and mixing, in minimizing resistance evolution and maximizing uninfecteds, as long as there is no influx of double resistance into the focal treated community.},

abstract = {Abstract Multidrug antibiotic resistance is an urgent public health concern. Multiple strate- gies have been suggested to alleviate this problem, including the use of antibiotic combinations and cyclic therapies. We examine how adaptation to (1) combinations of drugs affects resistance to individual drugs, and to (2) individual drugs alters re- sponses to drug combinations. To evaluate this, we evolved multiple strains of drug resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in the lab. We show that evolving resistance to four highly synergistic combinations does not result in cross-resistance to all of their components. Likewise, prior resistance to one antibiotic in a combination does not guarantee survival when exposed to the combination. We also identify four 3-step and four 2-step treatments that inhibit bacterial growth and confer collateral sensi- tivity with each step, impeding the development of multidrug resistance. This study highlights the importance of considering higher-order drug combinations in sequential therapies and how antibiotic interactions can influence the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial populations.

Human-simulated unbound plasma concentrations of I/R at 1.25 g every 6 h (h), colistin at 360 mg daily, and amikacin at 25 mg/kg daily were reproduced alone and in combination against six imipenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa isolates in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model over 24 h. For I/R alone, the mean reductions in CFU ± the standard errors by 24 h were -2.52 ± 0.49, -1.49 ± 0.49, -1.15 ± 0.67, and -0.61 ± 0.10 log10 CFU/ml against isolates with MICs of 1/4, 2/4, 4/4, and 8/4 $\mu$g/ml, respectively. Amikacin alone also resulted in 24 h CFU reductions consistent with its MIC, while colistin CFU reductions did not differ. Resistant subpopulations were observed after 24 h in 1, 4, and 3 I/R-, colistin-, and amikacin-exposed isolates, respectively. The combination of I/R and colistin resulted in synergistic (n = 1) or additive (n = 2) interactions against three isolates with 24-h CFU reductions ranging from -2.62 to -4.67 log10 CFU/ml. The combination of I/R and amikacin exhibited indifferent interactions against all isolates, with combined drugs achieving -0.51- to -3.33-log10 CFU/ml reductions. No resistant subpopulations were observed during I/R and colistin combination studies, and when added to amikacin, I/R prevented the emergence of amikacin resistance. Against these six multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, I/R alone achieved significant CFU reductions against I/R-susceptible isolates. Combinations of I/R plus colistin resulted in additivity or synergy against some P. aeruginosa, whereas the addition of amikacin did not provide further antibacterial efficacy against these isolates.},

abstract = {The current study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial combination efficacies, and whether the sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of antibiotics can influent on the biofilm formation of S. aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of common antibacterial drugs was determined in vitro against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) alone and in combination with each other by using the broth microdilution method and the checkerboard micro-dilution method analyzed with the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), respectively. Regarding these results, antibacterial drug combinations were categorized as synergistic, interacting, antagonistic and indifferent, and most of the results were consistent with the previous reports. Additionally, the effects of sub-MIC of seven antimicrobials (kanamycin, acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, enrofloxacin, lincomycin, colistin sulfate, berberine, and clarithromycin) on S. aureus biofilm formation were determined via crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and real-time PCR. Our results demonstrate that all antibiotics, except acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, effectively reduced the S. aureus biofilm formation. In addition, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to analyze the relative expression levels of S. aureus biofilm-related genes such as sarA, fnbA, rbf, lrgA, cidA, and eno after the treatment at sub-MIC with all of the six antimicrobials. All antibiotics significantly inhibited the expression of these biofilm-related genes except for acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, which efficiently up-regulated these transcripts. These results provide the theoretical parameters for the selection of effective antimicrobial combinations in clinical therapy and demonstrate how to correctly use antibiotics at sub-MIC as preventive drugs.},

abstract = {Hospital-acquired bacterial infections lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality. The problem is exacerbated by antibiotic-resistant strains that delay or impede effective treatment. To ensure successful therapy and to manage antibiotic resistance, treatment protocols that draw on several different antibiotics might be used. This includes the administration of drug cocktails to individual patients (combination therapy) but also the random assignment of drugs to different patients (mixing) and a regular switch in the default drug used in the hospital from drug A to drug B and back (cycling). For more than 20 years, mathematical models have been used to assess the prospects of antibiotic combination therapy, mixing and cycling. But while tendencies in their ranking across studies have emerged, the picture remains surprisingly inconclusive and incomplete. In this article, we review existing modelling studies and demonstrate by means of examples how methodological factors complicate the emergence of a consistent picture. These factors include the choice of the criterion by which the effects of the protocols are compared, the model implementation and its analysis. We thereafter discuss how progress can be made and suggest future modelling directions.},

abstract = {Phenomenological relations such as Ohm's or Fourier's law have a venerable history in physics but are still scarce in biology. This situation restrains predictive theory. Here, we build on bacterial "growth laws,"which capture physiological feedback between translation and cell growth, to construct a minimal biophysical model for the combined action of ribosome- targeting antibiotics. Our model predicts drug interactions like antagonism or synergy solely from responses to individual drugs. We provide analytical results for limiting cases, which agree well with numerical results. We systematically refine the model by including direct physical interactions of different antibiotics on the ribosome. In a limiting case, our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for recent predictions of higher-order interactions that were derived using entropy maximization. We further refine the model to include the effects of antibiotics that mimic starvation and the presence of resistance genes. We describe the impact of a starvation-mimicking antibiotic on drug interactions analytically and verify it experimentally. Our extended model suggests a change in the type of drug interaction that depends on the strength of resistance, which challenges established rescaling paradigms. We experimentally show that the presence of unregulated resistance genes can lead to altered drug interaction, which agrees with the prediction of the model. While minimal, the model is readily adaptable and opens the door to predicting interactions of second and higher-order in a broad range of biological systems.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antibiotics reduce the net growth rate of bacterial populations they target. It is relevant to understand if effects of multiple antimicrobials are synergistic or antagonistic, in particular for AMP responses, because naturally occurring responses involve multiple AMPs. There are several competing proposals describing how multiple types of antimicrobials add up when applied in combination, such as Loewe additivity or Bliss independence. These additivity terms are defined ad hoc from abstract principles explaining the supposed interaction between the antimicrobials. Here, we link these ad hoc combination terms to a mathematical model that represents the dynamics of antimicrobial molecules hitting targets on bacterial cells. In this multi-hit model, bacteria are killed when a certain number of targets are hit by antimicrobials. Using this bottom-up approach reveals that Bliss independence should be the model of choice if no interaction between antimicrobial molecules is expected. Loewe additivity, on the other hand, describes scenarios in which antimicrobials affect the same components of the cell, i.e. are not acting independently. While our approach idealizes the dynamics of antimicrobials, it provides a conceptual underpinning of the additively terms. The choice of the additivity term is essential to determine synergy or antagonism of antimicrobials.

@article{Rezzoagli2020,
abstract = {Antibiotics are losing efficacy due to the rapid evolution and spread of resistance. Treatments targeting bacterial virulence factors have been considered as alternatives because they target virulence instead of pathogen viability, and should therefore exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, antivirulence treatments rarely clear infections, which compromises their clinical applications. Here, we explore the potential of combining antivirulence drugs with antibiotics against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We combined two antivirulence compounds (gallium, a siderophore quencher, and furanone C-30, a quorum sensing [QS] inhibitor) together with four clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tobramycin) in 9×9 drug concentration matrices. We found that drug-interaction patterns were concentration dependent, with promising levels of synergies occurring at intermediate drug concentrations for certain drug pairs. We then tested whether antivirulence compounds are potent adjuvants, especially when treating antibiotic resistant (AtbR) clones. We found that the addition of antivirulence compounds to antibiotics could restore growth inhibition for most AtbR clones, and even abrogate or reverse selection for resistance in five drug combination cases. Molecular analyses suggest that selection against resistant clones occurs when resistance mechanisms involve restoration of protein synthesis, but not when efflux pumps are up-regulated. Altogether, our work provides a first systematic analysis of antivirulence-antibiotic combinatorial treatments and suggests that such combinations have the potential to be both effective in treating infections and in limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

@article{Bliss1939,
abstract = {A quantitative analysis of the toxicity of drugs or poisons applied jointly requires that they be administered at several dosages in mixtures containing fixed proportions of the ingredients. From a study of the dosage‐mortality curves for several such mixtures, preferably in comparison with equivalent curves for the isolated active ingredients, most cases of combined action can be classified into one of three types: (1) The first type is that in which the constituents act independently and diversely, so that the toxicity of any combination can be predicted from that of the isolated components and from the association of susceptibilities to the two components. The coefficient of association can be measured experimentally and should be constant at all proportions of the ingredients. When high, the toxicity of the mixture is reduced. The form of the dosage‐mortality curve has been examined for several hypothetical mixtures. Whenever the curves for the two constituents were assumed to differ in slope, there was a relatively abrupt bend in the curve for the mixture, the rectilinear segments above and below the break approaching in slope the values for the original constituents. This observation indicates that in homogeneous populations the slope of a dosage‐mortality curve is of toxicological significance. Since the same numerical relations would be expected if a single poison were to have two independent lethal effects within the animal, there is theoretical basis for fitting the linear segments of a dosage‐mortality curve separately when a break occurs after transformation to probits and logarithms. This argument has been extended to time‐mortality experiments to explain the smoothly concave curves characteristic of natural mortality. (2) The second type of joint action is that in which the constituents act independently but similarly, so that one ingredient can be substituted at a constant ratio for any proportion of a second without altering the toxicity of the mixture. With homogeneous populations, dosage‐mortality curves for the separate ingredients and for all mixtures should be parallel. Although by hypothesis the susceptibility to one ingredient is completely correlated with that to the other, mixtures in this category are more toxic than in the preceding class where association may vary from 0 to 1. The numerical relations have been illustrated by an experiment on the toxicity to the house‐fly of solutions containing pyrethrin and rotenone. A mixture with a little less than four equitoxic units of pyrethrin to one of rotenone agreed closely with the definition but one in which the ingredients were about equally balanced showed a significantly greater toxicity than expected on the hypothesis of independent action, indicating the presence of synergism. (3) Synergism forms the third type of joint action, characterized by a toxicity greater than that predicted from studies on the isolated constituents. It is the reverse of antagonism, which has not been considered directly. Two methods are proposed for the analysis of synergism. The more direct is to relate equitoxic dosages of mixture to its percentage composition in terms of the more active ingredient. When both are in logarithms the relation is linear over a useful range of compositions. This procedure preserves the original structure of the experiment, can be extended readily to three or more ingredients and leads to a convenient practical result. Theoretically it is less satisfactory than a second method in which for equitoxic dosages of each mixture the content of one ingredient (A) is related to the content of the other (B.) The equation which satisfies this relation most completely is (1 +k1A) Bi=k2, where the three constants are computed from the experimental data. When the exponent i is equal to 1, only two constants need be determined and their product, k1k2, is proposed as a measure of the intensity of synergism. The synergism between a nitro‐phenol and petroleum oil has been computed by both methods. For mixtures containing from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 5{\%} of the nitrophenol, the deposit of mixture (Dc) killing 98 {\%} of the eggs of a plant bug could be expressed adequately in terms of the percentage of the phenol (Q) as log Dc= 0{\textperiodcentered}687‐0{\textperiodcentered}307 log Q, for 98{\%} of overwintering San Jose scale as log Dc= 0{\textperiodcentered}472 ‐0{\textperiodcentered}363 log Q. All observations, including those for a 0{\textperiodcentered}1 {\%} mixture and for oil alone which were omitted in the first method, could be fitted satisfactorily in terms of the separate ingredients. For plant bug eggs at LD50, (1+25{\textperiodcentered}6A) B= 4{\textperiodcentered}29 and for San Jose scale (1 + 66{\textperiodcentered}7 A) B= 2{\textperiodcentered}73: in both cases i= 1 and the intensity of synergism 110 and 182 respectively. The full procedure has also been applied to the constituents of seven samples of Derris root. One sample gave an unaccountably low toxicity and was omitted. The log LD 50 of ether extract for the remaining six was related to the percentage composition of two components in the extract, rotenone (A) and dehydro mixture (B.) Since the toxicity of extract could be expressed almost entirely in terms of these particular two constituents, they were then related to each other by the second method. None of the samples contained a very small proportion of one ingredient, so that several equations were equally applicable, one of them being (1+0–714A) B= 56{\textperiodcentered}1, from which the intensity of synergism was 40. The problem of measuring synergism in fumigants has been discussed briefly. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1939, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

However, the terms are not used in exactly the same way by both groups. This comes because the standard modeling approach disregards the perspective of individual patients. In this article, we investigate a model that comes closer to clinical practice and compare the predictions to the standard model. We set up two deterministic models, implemented as a set of differential equations, for the spread of bacterial infections in a hospital. Following the traditional approach, the first model takes a population-based perspective. The second model, in contrast, takes the drug use of individual patients into account. The alternative model can indeed lead to different predictions than the standard model. We provide examples for which in the new model, the opposite strategy maximizes the number of uninfected patients or minimizes the rate of spread of double resistance. While the traditional models provide valuable insight, care is hence needed in the interpretation of results.},

abstract = {Objectives: The in vitro effects of caspofungin combined with voriconazole and amphotericin B were tested in triplicate experiments against nine clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus. Methods: The isolates were tested against a range of concentrations of voriconazole (0.015-1.0 mg/L), caspofungin (0.125-256 mg/L) and five concentrations of amphotericin B (0.1-0.5 mg/L) with a microdilution chequerboard method based on the CLSI M38-A reference method and the results were analysed with the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. The effect of individual drugs on the FIC index of each of the double combinations was also evaluated. Results: The triple combinationof voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B against all Aspergillus spp. was synergistic (FIC index 0.49-0.57) at low median concentrations of amphotericin B (0.10-0.22 mg/ L) and voriconazole (0.07-0.15 mg/L) over a wide range of caspofungin concentrations (4.32-17.28 mg/L). Antagonistic interactions (FIC index 1.65-2.15) were found at higher median concentrations of amphotericin B (0.3-0.5 mg/L) and voriconazole (0.23-0.68 mg/L) over a similarly wide range of caspofungin concentrations (1.47-32 mg/L). Conclusions: These concentration-dependent interactions may have important clinical implications, which require further evaluation in animal models of invasive aspergillosis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},
