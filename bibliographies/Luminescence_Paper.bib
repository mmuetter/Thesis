abstract = {Bacteria can be dead, alive, or exhibit slowed or suspended life forms, making bacterial death difficult to establish. Here, agar-plating, microscopic-counting, SYTO9/propidium-iodide staining, MTT-conversion, and bioluminescence-imaging were used to determine bacterial death upon exposure to different conditions. Rank correlations between pairs of assay outcomes were low, indicating different assays measure different aspects of bacterial death. Principal-component analysis yielded two principal components, named “reproductive-ability” (PC1) and “metabolic-activity” (PC2). Plotting of these principal components in two-dimensional space revealed a dead region, with borders defined by the PC1 and PC2 values. Sensu stricto implies an unpractical reality that all assays determining PC1 and PC2 must be carried out in order to establish bacterial death. Considering this unpracticality, it is suggested that at least one assay determining reproductive activity (PC1) and one assay determining metabolic activity (PC2) should be used to establish bacterial death. Minimally, researchers should specifically describe which dimension of bacterial death is assessed, when addressing bacterial death.},

abstract = {Background: Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Resistance to first-line empirical monotherapy has emerged, so robust methods are needed to evaluate the activity of existing and novel antimicrobials against the bacterium. Pharmacodynamic models describing the relationship between the concentration of antimicrobials and the minimum growth rate of the bacteria provide more detailed information than the MIC only. Results: In this study, a novel standardised in vitro time-kill curve assay was developed. The assay was validated using five World Health Organization N. gonorrhoeae reference strains and a range of ciprofloxacin concentrations below and above the MIC. Then the activity of nine antimicrobials with different target mechanisms was examined against a highly antimicrobial susceptible clinical strain isolated in 1964. The experimental time-kill curves were analysed and quantified with a previously established pharmacodynamic model. First, the bacterial growth rates at each antimicrobial concentration were estimated with linear regression. Second, we fitted the model to the growth rates, resulting in four parameters that describe the pharmacodynamic properties of each antimicrobial. A gradual decrease of bactericidal effects from ciprofloxacin to spectinomycin and gentamicin was found. The beta-lactams ceftriaxone, cefixime and benzylpenicillin showed bactericidal and time-dependent properties. Chloramphenicol and tetracycline were purely bacteriostatic as they fully inhibited the growth but did not kill the bacteria. We also tested ciprofloxacin resistant strains and found higher pharmacodynamic MICs (zMIC) in the resistant strains and attenuated bactericidal effects at concentrations above the zMIC. Conclusions: N. gonorrhoeae time-kill curve experiments analysed with a pharmacodynamic model have potential for in vitro evaluation of new and existing antimicrobials. The pharmacodynamic parameters based on a wide range of concentrations below and above the MIC provide information that could support improving future dosing strategies to treat gonorrhoea.},

abstract = {The use of transformations to stabilize the variance of binomial or Poisson data is familiar(Anscombe 1, Bartlett 2, 3, Curtiss 4, Eisenhart 5). The comparison of transformed binomial or Poisson data with percentage points of the normal distribution to make approximate significance tests or to set approximate confidence intervals is less familiar. Mosteller and Tukey 6 have recently made a graphical application of a transformation related to the square-root transformation for such purposes, where the use of "binomial probability paper" avoids all computation. We report here on an empirical study of a number of approximations, some intended for significance and confidence work and others for variance stabilization. For significance testing and the setting of confidence limits, we should like to use the normal deviate K exceeded with the same probability as the number of successes x from n in a binomial distribution with expectation np, which is defined by frac12pi int{\^{}}K-infty e{\^{}}-frac12t{\^{}}2 dt = operatornameProb x leq k mid operatornamebinomial, n, p. The most useful approximations to K that we can propose here are N (very simple), N{\^{}}+ (accurate near the usual percentage points), and N{\^{}}astast (quite accurate generally), where N = 2 (sqrt(k + 1)q - sqrt(n - k)p). (This is the approximation used with binomial probability paper.) N{\^{}}+ = N + fracN + 2p - 112sqrtE,quad E = textlesser of np textand nq, N{\^{}}ast = N + frac(N - 2)(N + 2)12 big(frac1sqrtnp + 1 - frac1sqrtnq + 1big), N{\^{}}astast = N{\^{}}ast + fracN{\^{}}ast + 2p - 112 sqrtEcdotquad E = textlesser of np textand nq.

abstract = {Cationic amphipathic peptides have been extensively investigated as a potential source of new antimicrobials that can complement current antibiotic regimens in the face of emerging drug-resistant bacteria. However, the suppression of antimicrobial activity under certain biologically relevant conditions (e.g., serum and physiological salt concentrations) has hampered efforts to develop safe and effective antimicrobial peptides for clinical use. We have analyzed the activity and selectivity of the human peptide LL37 and the de novo engineered antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 in several biologically relevant conditions. The host-derived synthetic peptide LL37 displayed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but demonstrated staphylococcus-specific sensitivity to NaCl concentrations varying from 50 to 300 niM. Moreover, LL37 potency was variably suppressed in the presence of 1 to 6 mM Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions. In contrast, WLBU2 maintained its activity in NaCl and physiologic serum concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+. WLBU2 is able to kill P. aeruginosa (106 CFU/ml) in human serum, with a minimum bactericidal concentration of {\textless}9 $\mu$M. Conversely, LL37 is inactive in the presence of human serum. Bacterial killing kinetic assays in serum revealed that WLBU2 achieved complete bacterial killing in 20 min. Consistent with these results was the ability of WLBU2 (15 to 20 $\mu$M) to eradicate bacteria from ex vivo samples of whole blood. The selectivity of WLBU2 was further demonstrated by its ability to specifically eliminate P. aeruginosa in coculture with human monocytes or skin fibroblasts without detectable adverse effects to the host cells. Finally, WLBU2 displayed potent efficacy against P. aeruginosa in an intraperitoneal infection model using female Swiss Webster mice. These results establish a potential application of WLBU2 in the treatment of bacterial sepsis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including the possible advantage of sexual reproduction, depend critically on the effects of deleterious mutations on fitness. Limited existing experimental evidence suggests that, on average, such effects tend to be aggravated under environmental stresses, consistent with the perception that stress diminishes the organism's ability to tolerate deleterious mutations. Here, we ask whether there are also stresses with the opposite influence, under which the organism becomes more tolerant to mutations. Results: We developed a technique, based on bioluminescence, which allows accurate automated measurements of bacterial growth rates at very low cell densities. Using this system, we measured growth rates of Escherichia coli mutants under a diverse set of environmental stresses. In contrast to the perception that stress always reduces the organism's ability to tolerate mutations, our measurements identified stresses that do the opposite - that is, despite decreasing wild-type growth, they alleviate on average the effect of deleterious mutations. Conclusions: Our results show a qualitative difference between various environmental stresses ranging from alleviation to aggravation of the average effect of mutations. We further show how the existence of stresses that are biased towards alleviation of the effects of mutations may imply the existence of average epistatic interactions between mutations. The results thus offer a connection between the two main factors controlling the effects of deleterious mutations: environmental conditions and epistatic interactions.},

abstract = {Filamentation is a reversible morphological change triggered in response to various stresses that bacteria might encounter in the environment, during host infection or antibiotic treatments. Here we re-visit the dynamics of filament formation and recovery using a consistent framework based on live-cells microscopy. We compare the fate of filamentous Escherichia coli induced by cephalexin that inhibits cell division or by UV-induced DNA-damage that additionally perturbs chromosome segregation. We show that both filament types recover by successive and accelerated rounds of divisions that preferentially occur at the filaments' tip, thus resulting in the rapid production of multiple daughter cells with tightly regulated size. The DNA content, viability and further division of the daughter cells essentially depends on the coordination between chromosome segregation and division within the mother filament. Septum positioning at the filaments' tip depends on the Min system, while the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA regulates the timing of division to prevent septum closure on unsegregated chromosomes. Our results not only recapitulate earlier conclusions but provide a higher level of detail regarding filaments division and the fate of the daughter cells. Together with previous reports, this work uncovers how filamentation recovery allows for a rapid cell proliferation after stress treatment.},

abstract = {Multidrug treatments are increasingly important in medicine and for probing biological systems1-6. Although many studies have focused on interactions between specific drugs, little is known about the system properties of a full drug interaction network6. Like their genetic counterparts, two drugs may have no interaction, or they may interact synergistically or antagonistically to increase or suppress their individual effects. Here we use a sensitive bioluminescence technique7,8 to provide quantitative measurements of pairwise interactions among 21 antibiotics that affect growth rate in Escherichia coli. We find that the drug interaction network possesses a special property: it can be separated into classes of drugs such that any two classes interact either purely synergistically or purely antagonistically. These classes correspond directly to the cellular functions affected by the drugs. This network approach provides a new conceptual framework for understanding the functional mechanisms of drugs and their cellular targets and can be applied in systems intractable to mutant screening, biochemistry or microscopy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Trimethoprim has recently been marketed as a single‐entity product for the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated symptomatic urinary tract infections; it was previously available only in combination with sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim exerts antimicrobial activity by blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid, by susceptible organisms. It has inhibitory activity for most gram‐positive aerobic cocci and some gram‐negative aerobic bacilli. Resistance to trimethoprim may be either intrinsic or acquired. Acquired resistance most commonly stems from a chromosomal mutation that results in the production of a dihydrofolate reductase enzyme which is less vulnerable to trimethoprim inhibition. Gastrointestinal intolerance and skin eruptions are the most common untoward reactions resulting from the administration of trimethoprim. Trimethoprim constitutes very effective therapy for women with acute symptomatic urinary tract infections caused by E. coli, and the compound compares favorably with alternative standard agents, such as ampicillin and cephalexin. The safety of trimethoprim in the pregnant woman has not been established. Since indiscriminate use of trimethoprim could foster the emergence of trimethoprim resistance, thereby negating the value of both trimethoprim and trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim should only be prescribed for well defined indications. Trimethoprim is currently being investigated as definitive therapy for a wide range of infections, including bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia, and typhoid fever.

Here, we explain these interactions by “translation bottlenecks”: points in the translation cycle where antibiotics block ribosomal progression. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions between translation inhibitors, we generate translation bottlenecks genetically using inducible control of translation factors that regulate well-defined translation cycle steps. These perturbations accurately mimic antibiotic action and drug interactions, supporting that the interplay of different translation bottlenecks causes these interactions. We further show that growth laws, combined with drug uptake and binding kinetics, enable the direct prediction of a large fraction of observed interactions, yet fail to predict suppression. However, varying two translation bottlenecks simultaneously supports that dense traffic of ribosomes and competition for translation factors account for the previously unexplained suppression. These results highlight the importance of “continuous epistasis” in bacterial physiology.},

abstract = {Investigations of bacterial survival in natural environments have indicated that some organisms lose culturability on appropriate media under certain conditions and yet still exhibit signs of metabolic activity and thus viability. This reproducible loss of culturability in many bacterial species led to the description of a "Viable But Non Culturable" (VBNC) state. The purpose of this article is to determine environmental and physico-chemical factors which induce the VBNC state in a food-borne pathogen that has become a public concern: Listeria monocytogenes. The factors, i.e. inoculum size, natural sunlight, temperature (4 °C or 20 °C , NaCl concentration (0{\%} or 7{\%}) and pH (5 or 6) were studied on 4 strains (LO28, ATCC 19115, Scott A, CNL 895807). The culturability of the starved cell suspension was determined in each condition tested by the spread plate count, and the cell activity was determined by the Direct Viable Count technique and CTC-DAPI double staining. A strain effect was found in different test conditions. For the LO 28 and ATCC 19115 strains, the VBNC state was very transient in certain conditions. For the other strains tested (Scott A, CNL 895807), the VBNC state was maintained throughout the observation period. In the dark, the incubation temperature was the main factor in the production of VBNC forms in L. monocytogenes. However, natural sunlight rapidly produced the VBNC state in L. monocytogenes cells in microcosm water. We conclude that because of its ubiquity and the factors studied which are met in the food industry, the presence of VBNC L. monocytogenes cells could pose a major public health problem since they cannot be detected by traditional culturing methods. Further investigations are needed to establish virulence before and after resuscitation of VBNC L. monocytogenes cells.},

abstract = {We have developed a simple and highly efficient method to disrupt chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). In this procedure, recombination requires the phage $\lambda$ Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.},

abstract = {It was shown by Bigger (1944), Parker and Marsh (1946), and Parker and Luse (1948) that if staphylococci were exposed to lethal concentrations of penicillin in vitro, and if the drug was removed before all the organisms had been killed, the viable survivors did not then immediately resume multiplication. There followed instead a period of bacteriostasis during which the organisms, presumably recovering from the toxic effects of the drug, remained essentially constant in number. As will be shown in the present paper, this sublethal toxic effect of penicillin is not peculiar to staphylococci, but has been observed with every bacterial species studied so far. A number of factors have been found to modify both the toxic effect of the drug and the subsequent recovery of the damaged bacteria. Some implications with respect to the mode of action of penicillin are discussed in the text. METHODS AND MATERIALS Suspensions of bacteria during the logarithmic phase of growth were exposed at 37 C to varying concentrations of penicillin G. At intervals during this period, aliquot samples were withdrawn and the bactericidal action of the penicillin was terminated by the addition of "clarase" (Takamine) or "penicillinase" (Schenley) in appropriate concentrations. In the amounts used, the penicillin was almost completely inactivated within less than 5 minutes. This was shown by the fact that if mixtures of penicillin and the inactivating agent in the experimental concentrations were incubated for 5 minutes and then inoculated with bacteria, the organisms grew out at the same rate as they did in control tubes containing no penicillin. The number of viable organisms' in the aliquot samples at the time of penicillin inactivation was determined by plating out serial 40-fold dilutions in an appropri-1 It has been shown with cultured treponemata that organisms already rendered non-viable by penicillin may nevertheless remain actively motile for a number of hours (Eagle and Musselman, 1944). The agar plating technique here used determines, not the number of organisms that are still alive at the moment of penicillin inactivation, but the number of viable organisms capable of growing out in subculture. It follows that the bactericidal process as measured by this technique should stop abruptly when the penicillin is removed, unless the reacting mixture contains toxic factors other than penicillin which continue to cause the death of the organisms after the disappearance of the drug, but which are in-activated by dilution in blood agar. In most instances, the bactericidal process did cease abruptly on the addition of penicillinase; in some of the experiments, however, there was an unexplained continuing decrease in the number of viable bacteria for a period of approximately one hour.},

Drug susceptibility was assessed by a simple method based on the efficient production of photons by viable mycobacteria infected with specific reporter phages expressing the firefly luciferase gene. Light production was dependent on phage infection, expression of the luciferase gene, and the level of cellular adenosine triphosphate. Signals could be detected within minutes after infection of virulent M. tuberculosis with reporter phages. Culture of conventional strains with antituberculosis drugs, including isoniazid or rifampicin, resulted in extinction of light production. In contrast, light signals after luciferase reporter phage infection of drug-resistant strains continued to be produced.

abstract = {Traditional microbiological techniques are used to provide reliable data on the rate and extent of kill for a range of biocides. However, such techniques provide very limited data regarding the initial rate of kill of fast-acting biocides over very short time domains. This study describes the application of a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli expressing the Photorhabdus luminescens lux operon as a whole-cell biosensor. Light emission is linked directly to bacterial metabolism; therefore, by monitoring light output, the impact of fast-acting biocides can be assessed. Electrochemically activated solutions (ECASs), bleach, Virkon, and ethanol were assessed at three concentrations (1{\%}, 10{\%}, 80{\%}) in the presence of organic soiling. Over a 2-s time course, 80{\%} ECAS produced the greatest reduction in light output in the absence of organic load but was strongly inhibited by its presence. Eighty percent ethanol outperformed all tested biocides in the presence of organic soil. Bleach and Virkon produced similar reductions in bioluminescence at matched concentrations within the time course of the assay. It was also demonstrated that the assay can be used to rapidly assess the impact of organic soiling. The use of bioluminescent bacteria as whole-cell bioreporters allows assessment of the relative efficacies of fast-acting biocides within milliseconds of application. The assay can be used to investigate activity over short or extended time domains to confirm complete metabolic inhibition of the bioreporter. Moreover, the assay may enable further elucidation of their mechanism of action by allowing the investigation of activity over time domains precluded by traditional microbiology.

abstract = {Effective antibiotic use that minimizes treatment failures remains a challenge. A better understanding of how bacterial populations respond to antibiotics is necessary. Previous studies of large bacterial populations established the deterministic framework of pharmacodynamics. Here, characterizing the dynamics of population extinction, we demonstrated the stochastic nature of eradicating bacteria with antibiotics. Antibiotics known to kill bacteria (bactericidal) induced population fluctuations. Thus, at high antibiotic concentrations, the dynamics of bacterial clearance were heterogeneous. At low concentrations, clearance still occurred with a non-zero probability. These striking outcomes of population fluctuations were well captured by our probabilistic model. Our model further suggested a strategy to facilitate eradication by increasing extinction probability. We experimentally tested this prediction for antibiotic-susceptible and clinically-isolated resistant bacteria. This new knowledge exposes fundamental limits in our ability to predict bacterial eradication. Additionally, it demonstrates the potential of using antibiotic concentrations that were previously deemed inefficacious to eradicate bacteria.},

Despite this complexity, in most cases only a single pharmacodynamic parameter, the MIC of the drug, is employed for the rational development of antibiotic treatment regimens. In this report, we use a mathematical model based on a Hill function - which we call the pharmacodynamic function and which is related to previously published E max models - to describe the relationship between the bacterial net growth rates and the concentrations of antibiotics of five different classes: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and rifampin. Using Escherichia coli O18:K1:H7, we illustrate how precise estimates of the four parameters of the pharmacodynamic function can be obtained from in vitro time-kill data. We show that, in addition to their respective MICs, these antibiotics differ in the values of the other pharmacodynamic parameters. Using a computer simulation of antibiotic treatment in vivo, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of differences in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as the steepness of the Hill function and the minimum bacterial net growth rate attained at high antibiotic concentrations, there can be profound differences in the microbiological efficacy of antibiotics with identical MICs. We discuss the clinical implications and limitations of these results.},

abstract = {The emergence of drug resistant pathogens is a serious public health problem. It is a long-standing goal to predict rates of resistance evolution and design optimal treatment strategies accordingly. To this end, it is crucial to reveal the underlying causes of drug-specific differences in the evolutionary dynamics leading to resistance. However, it remains largely unknown why the rates of resistance evolution via spontaneous mutations and the diversity of mutational paths vary substantially between drugs. Here we comprehensively quantify the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, a key determinant of evolutionary dynamics, in the presence of eight antibiotics representing the main modes of action. Using precise high-throughput fitness measurements for genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains, we find that the width of the DFE varies dramatically between antibiotics and, contrary to conventional wisdom, for some drugs the DFE width is lower than in the absence of stress. We show that this previously underappreciated divergence in DFE width among antibiotics is largely caused by their distinct drug-specific dose-response characteristics. Unlike the DFE, the magnitude of the changes in tolerated drug concentration resulting from genome-wide mutations is similar for most drugs but exceptionally small for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin, i.e., mutations generally have considerably smaller resistance effects for nitrofurantoin than for other drugs. A population genetics model predicts that resistance evolution for drugs with this property is severely limited and confined to reproducible mutational paths. We tested this prediction in laboratory evolution experiments using the “morbidostat”, a device for evolving bacteria in well-controlled drug environments. Nitrofurantoin resistance indeed evolved extremely slowly via reproducible mutations—an almost paradoxical behavior since this drug causes DNA damage and increases the mutation rate. Overall, we identified novel quantitative characteristics of the evolutionary landscape that provide the conceptual foundation for predicting the dynamics of drug resistance evolution.},

abstract = {Dose‐response relationships are a general concept for quantitatively describing biological systems across multiple scales, from the molecular to the whole‐cell level. A clinically relevant example is the bacterial growth response to antibiotics, which is routinely characterized by dose‐response curves. The shape of the dose‐response curve varies drastically between antibiotics and plays a key role for treatments, drug interactions, and resistance evolution. However, the mechanisms shaping the dose‐response curve remain largely unclear. Here, we show in Escherichia coli that the distinctively shallow dose‐response curve of the antibiotic trimethoprim is caused by a negative growth‐ mediated feedback loop: Trimethoprim slows growth, which in turn weakens the effect of this antibiotic. At the molecular level, this feedback is caused by the upregulation of the drug target dihydrofolate reductase (FolA/DHFR). We show that this upregulation is not a specific response to trimethoprim but follows a universal trend line that depends only on growth rate, irrespective of its cause. Rewiring the feedback loop alters the dose‐response curve in a predictable manner, which we corroborate with a mathematical model. Our results indicate that growth‐mediated feedback loops shape drug responses and could be exploited to design evolutionary traps that enable selection against drug resistance.

abstract = {Antibiotic effectiveness depends on a variety of factors. While many mechanistic details of antibiotic action are known, the connection between death rate and bacterial physiology is poorly understood. A common observation is that death rate in antibiotics rises linearly with growth rate; however, it remains unclear how other factors, such as environmental conditions and whole-cell physiological properties, affect bactericidal activity. To address this, we developed a high-throughput assay to precisely measure antibiotic-mediated death. We found that death rate is linear in growth rate, but the slope depends on environmental conditions. Growth under stress lowers death rate compared to nonstressed environments with similar growth rate. To understand stress's role, we developed a mathematical model of bacterial death based on resource allocation that includes a stress-response sector; we identify this sector using RNA-seq. Our model accurately predicts the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) with zero free parameters across a wide range of growth conditions. The model also quantitatively predicts death and MIC when sectors are experimentally modulated using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), including protection from death at very low cAMP levels. The present study shows that different conditions with equal growth rate can have different death rates and establishes a quantitative relation between growth, death, and MIC that suggests approaches to improve antibiotic efficacy.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human health around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR on incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific pathogen–drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study presents the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date. Methods: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen–drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. We used predictive statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data. Our approach can be divided into five broad components: number of deaths where infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden based on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the global and regional level. Findings: On the basis of our predictive statistical models, there were an estimated 4{\textperiodcentered}95 million (3{\textperiodcentered}62–6{\textperiodcentered}57) deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1{\textperiodcentered}27 million (95{\%} UI 0{\textperiodcentered}911–1{\textperiodcentered}71) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age death rate attributable to resistance to be highest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 27{\textperiodcentered}3 deaths per 100 000 (20{\textperiodcentered}9–35{\textperiodcentered}3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6{\textperiodcentered}5 deaths (4{\textperiodcentered}3–9{\textperiodcentered}4) per 100 000. Lower respiratory infections accounted for more than 1{\textperiodcentered}5 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019, making it the most burdensome infectious syndrome. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance (Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were responsible for 929 000 (660 000–1 270 000) deaths attributable to AMR and 3{\textperiodcentered}57 million (2{\textperiodcentered}62–4{\textperiodcentered}78) deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One pathogen–drug combination, meticillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six more each caused 50 000–100 000 deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen–drug combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location-specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics.

abstract = {Objectives: To utilize bioluminescence to follow the effect of ciprofloxacin challenge on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Methods: The Sorbarod continuous perfusion culture system was used for the cultivation of biofilms of a self-bioluminescent strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Biofilms were challenged with ciprofloxacin (5 mg/L) in the perfusing medium for 3 h and allowed to recover to pre-challenge population levels before initiation of a second 3 h challenge. In addition to determining eluate and biofilm cell survival by conventional viable plate counts, light output was monitored via a luminometer and a low-light-level ICCD camera, to give an indication of metabolism. The effect of drug challenge on biofilm structure was investigated using an environmental scanning electron microscope, which allowed discernment of changes to the three-dimensional biofilm architecture. Results: On challenge with ciprofloxacin, eluate light output measurements declined to a lesser extent than viable counts for the same samples and also indicated that post-challenge recovery of the biofilm metabolism did not occur as rapidly as suggested by viable count data. Photon detection by ICCD camera allowed real-time, non-invasive imaging of metabolic activity within intact biofilms. Conclusions: The application of a bioluminescent reporter strain to biofilm research provides valuable real-time positional data on the efficacy of anti-biofilm treatment strategies. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {The intracellular (IC) effect of drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is not well established but increasingly important to consider when combining current and future multidrug regimens into the best possible treatment strategies. For this purpose, we developed an IC model based on a genetically modified Mtb H37Rv strain, expressing the Vibrio harvei luciferase (H37Rv-lux) infecting the human macrophage like cell line THP-1. Cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (1:1) and subsequently exposed to isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB), amikacin (AMI) or levofloxacin (LEV) for 5. days in a 96-well format. Cell viability was evaluated by Calcein AM and was maintained throughout the experiment. The number of viable H37Rv-lux was determined by luminescence and verified by a colony forming unit analysis. The results were compared to the effects of the same drugs in broth cultures. AMI, EMB and LEV were significantly less effective intracellularly (MIC90: {\textgreater}. 4. mg/L, 8. mg/L and 2. mg/L, respectively) compared to extracellularly (MIC90: 0.5. mg/L for AMI and EMB; 0.25. mg/L for LEV). The reverse was the case for INH (IC: 0.064. mg/L vs EC: 0.25. mg/L). In conclusion, this luciferase based method, in which monitoring of cell viability is included, has the potential to become a useful tool while evaluating the intracellular effects of anti-mycobacterial drugs.},

The mathematical principles of the theory of these processes are briefly described. Birth-and-death processes, with some straightforward additions such as innovation, are a simple, natural and formal framework for modeling a vast variety of biological processes such as population dynamics, speciation, genome evolution, including growth of paralogous gene families and horizontal gene transfer and somatic evolution of cancers. We further describe how empirical data, e.g. distributions of paralogous gene family size, can be used to choose the model that best reflects the actual course of evolution among different versions of birth-death-and-innovation models. We conclude that birth-and-death processes, thanks to their mathematical transparency, flexibility and relevance to fundamental biological processes, are going to be an indispensable mathematical tool for the burgeoning field of systems biology. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {The importance of iron to bacteria is shown by the presence of numerous iron-scavenging and transport systems and by many genes whose expression is tightly regulated by iron availability. We have taken a global approach to gene expression analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in response to iron by combining efficient, high-throughput methods with sensitive, luminescent reporting of gene expression using a random promoter library. Real-time expression profiles of the library were generated under low- and high-iron conditions to identify iron-regulated promoters, including a number of previously identified genes. Our results indicate that approximately 7{\%} of the genome may be regulated directly or indirectly by iron. Further analysis of these clones using a Fur titration assay revealed three separate classes of genes; two of these classes consist of Fur-regulated genes. A third class was Fur independent and included both negatively and positively iron-responsive genes. These may reflect new iron-dependent regulons. Iron-responsive genes included iron transporters, iron storage and mobility proteins, iron-containing proteins (redox proteins, oxidoreductases, and cytochromes), transcriptional regulators, and the energy transducer tonB. By identifying a wide variety of iron-responsive genes, we extend our understanding of the global effect of iron availability on gene expression in the bacterial cell.},

Little is known about the proliferation of prokaryotic life under conditions of hyper-acceleration attributable to extreme gravity, however. We found that living organisms can be surprisingly proliferative during hyperacceleration. In tests reported here, a variety of microorganisms, including Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Shewanella amazonensis; Gram-positive Lactobacillus delbrueckii; and eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cultured while being subjected to hyperaccelerative conditions. We observed and quantified robust cellular growth in these cultures across a wide range of hyperacceleration values. Most notably, the organisms P. denitrificans and E. coli were able to proliferate even at 403,627 x g. Analysis shows that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for their proliferation under conditions of hyper-acceleration. Our results indicate that microorganisms cannot only survive during hyperacceleration but can display such robust proliferative behavior that the habitability of extraterrestrial environments must not be limited by gravity.},

abstract = {A better understanding of how antibiotic exposure impacts the evolution of resistance in bacterial populations is crucial for designing more sustainable treatment strategies. The conventional approach to this question is to measure the range of concentrations over which resistant strain(s) are selectively favored over a sensitive strain. Here, we instead investigate how antibiotic concentration impacts the initial establishment of resistance from single cells, mimicking the clonal expansion of a resistant lineage following mutation or horizontal gene transfer. Using two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carrying resistance plasmids, we show that single resistant cells have {\textless}5{\%} probability of detectable outgrowth at antibiotic concentrations as low as one-eighth of the resistant strain's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). This low probability of establishment is due to detrimental effects of antibiotics on resistant cells, coupled with the inherently stochastic nature of cell division and death on the single-cell level, which leads to loss of many nascent resistant lineages. Our findings suggest that moderate doses of antibiotics, well below the MIC of resistant strains, may effectively restrict de novo emergence of resistance even though they cannot clear already-large resistant populations.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear1,2. Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti-Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication3, 4–5. Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many bacterial species have been found to exist in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state since its discovery in 1982. VBNC cells are characterized by a loss of culturability on routine agar, which impairs their detection by conventional plate count techniques. This leads to an underestimation of total viable cells in environmental or clinical samples, and thus poses a risk to public health. In this review, we present recent findings on the VBNC state of human bacterial pathogens. The characteristics of VBNC cells, including the similarities and differences to viable, culturable cells and dead cells, and different detection methods are discussed. Exposure to various stresses can induce the VBNC state, and VBNC cells may be resuscitated back to culturable cells under suitable stimuli. The conditions that trigger the induction of the VBNC state and resuscitation from it are summarized and the mechanisms underlying these two processes are discussed. Last but not least, the significance of VBNC cells and their potential influence on human health are also reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Li, Mendis, Trigui, Oliver, Faucher.},

We describe a method which identifies some of the covariants involved in determinations of minimal lethal concentrations. Lethality was defined as a 99.9{\%} reduction in the initial inoculum of bacteria after 24 h of incubation. We limited the sample volume to 0.01 ml to minimize the inhibitory effect of antibiotic carried over to the subculture plates. We provided a range for the initial inoculum and corresponding rejection values, which detected lethality with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. When the number of colonies on subculture was equal to or less than the rejection value, the antibiotic was considered lethal for the test organism. Rejection values encompassed initial inocula from 105 to 107 colony-forming units per ml for single and duplicate samples and allowed for 1 or 5{\%} variability in pipette volumes and errors in initial inoculum determinations. This method was used to determine the minimal lethal concentrations of semisynthetic penicillins for S. aureus isolates, one of which was tolerant to the killing action of penicillin.},

abstract = {Multidrug combinations are increasingly important in combating the spread of antibiotic-resistance in bacterial pathogens. On a broader scale, such combinations are also important in understanding microbial ecology and evolution. Although the effects of multidrug combinations on bacterial growth have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about their impact on the differential selection between sensitive and resistant bacterial populations. Normally, the presence of a drug confers an advantage on its resistant mutants in competition with the sensitive wild-type population. Here we show, by using a direct competition assay between doxycycline-resistant and doxycycline-sensitive Escherichia coli, that this differential selection can be inverted in a hyper-antagonistic class of drug combinations. Used in such a combination, a drug can render the combined treatment selective against the drug's own resistance allele. Further, this inversion of selection seems largely insensitive to the underlying resistance mechanism and occurs, at sublethal concentrations, while maintaining inhibition of the wild type. These seemingly paradoxical results can be rationalized in terms of a simple geometric argument. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated feature of the fitness landscape for the evolution of resistance and point to a trade-off between the effect of drug interactions on absolute potency and the relative competitive selection that they impose on emerging resistant populations. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Oliver2005,
abstract = {It had long been assumed that a bacterial cell was dead when it was no longer able to grow on routine culture media. We now know that this assumption is simplistic, and that there are many situations where a cell loses culturability but remains viable and potentially able to regrow. This mini-review defines what the "viable but nonculturable" (VBNC) state is, and illustrates the methods that can be used to show that a bacterial cell is in this physiological state. The diverse environmental factors which induce this state, and the variety of bacteria which have been shown to enter into the VBNC state, are listed. In recent years, a great amount of research has revealed what occurs in cells as they enter and exist in this state, and these studies are also detailed. The ability of cells to resuscitate from the VBNC state and return to an actively metabolizing and culturable form is described, as well as the ability of these cells to retain virulence. Finally, the question of why cells become nonculturable is addressed. It is hoped that this mini-review will encourage researchers to consider this survival state in their studies as an alternative to the conclusion that a lack of culturability indicates the cells they are examining are dead.

abstract = {The development of a rapid method for determining microbial susceptibilities to antibiotics using the firefly luciferase assay for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is documented. The reduction of bacterial ATP by an antimicrobial agent was determined to be a valid measure of drug effect in most cases. The effect of 12 antibiotics on 8 different bacterial species gave a 94 percent correlation with the standard Kirby-Buer-Agar disc diffusion method. A 93 percent correlation was obtained when the ATP assay method was applied directly to 50 urine specimens from patients with urinary tract infections. Urine samples were centrifuged first to that bacterial pellets could be suspended in broth. No primary isolation or subculturing was required. Mixed cultures in which one species was predominant gave accurate results for the most abundant organism. Since the method is based on an increase in bacterial ATP with time, the presence of leukocytes did not interfere with the interpretation of results. Both the incubation procedure and the ATP assays are compatible with automation.},

abstract = {The bactericidal effect (BE) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (PAE) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. Both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the MIC value. The BE and the PAE of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. Imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high BE and PAE values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. PAE is low or non-existent for Gram-negative strains with other $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.},

abstract = {Light is produced by recombinant Escherichia coli that contain lux genes cloned from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischen. The bioluminescence phenotype requires genes for regulatory and biochemical functions, the latter encoded by five lux genes contained in a single operon. These lux genes were disconnected from their native promoter and inserted into the transposon mini-Mu. The resulting transposon, mini-Mulux, could induce mutations by insertional inactivation of a target gene, and the lux DNA was oriented to align target gene transcription with that of the lux genes. Genes in Escherichia coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were mutagenized, and mutants containing transposon-generated lux gene fusions produced light as a function of target gene transcription. Light production offers a simple, sensitive, in vivo indicator of gene expression.},
