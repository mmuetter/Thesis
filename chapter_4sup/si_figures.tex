Normalised luminescence trajectories $y = \frac{I}{I(0)}$ for single-drug treatments.
Panels~(a--f) show trajectories across \num{12} single-drug concentrations for amoxicillin (AMO), chloramphenicol (CHL), colistin (COL), penicillin (PEN), polymyxin~B (POL), and tetracycline (TET), respectively.
For each concentration, we show \num{20} replicate curves obtained from five independent combination experiments (per drug) with four biological replicates each.
For trajectories that fall temporarily (less than 20\% of datapoints) below the detection limit, we substituted the respective timepoints with the detection limit (diamonds).
The last regular datapoint of an invalid trajectory (more than 20\% below the detection limit) is indicated with an ``x'', and all other datapoints are shown as circles.

Panels~(a--f) show the single-drug pharmacodynamic curves corresponding to the timecourse data for amoxicillin (AMO), chloramphenicol (CHL), colistin (COL), penicillin (PEN), polymyxin~B (POL), and tetracycline (TET), respectively.
For each concentration, we aggregate time-weighted net growth rate estimates from \num{20} replicates obtained from five independent combination experiments (per drug) with four biological replicates each.
We included only ``valid'' estimates, defined as trajectories with less than 20\% of timepoints below the LoD.
Valid estimates containing LoD-censored timepoints are shown as diamonds, and estimates without LoD-censored timepoints are shown as circles.
Marker size is scaled with $\log_{10}$ of the inoculum $I(0)$.
Curve parameters are fitted per drug using nonlinear least squares, and the shown confidence band is obtained from the parameter covariance matrix.

\InteractionGrid{mu_interaction_heatmap}{
Bliss interaction classification based on the distribution of Bliss interaction scores $\mu$.
For each concentration pair, treatment effects were resampled to obtain a distribution of the Bliss interaction index $\mu$.
Cells are colored according to statistical significance: teal indicates synergistic interactions (95\% confidence interval entirely below zero), orange indicates antagonistic interactions (95\% confidence interval entirely above zero), and white indicates no significant deviation from additivity.
We overlaid cells where all estimates were ``invalid'' due to LoD in dark grey, and cells that are not eligible (because either the combined treatment effect or both single-drug treatment effects are not significant) in light grey (see Methods, Data preprocessing).

Loewe interaction classification based on the distribution of Loewe interaction scores $\nu$.
Teal indicates significant synergy (95\% confidence interval entirely below 0), orange indicates significant antagonism (95\% confidence interval entirely above 0), and white indicates that the confidence interval contains 0.
We overlaid cells where all estimates were ``invalid'' due to LoD in dark grey, and cells that are not eligible (because either the combined treatment effect; or both single-drug treatment effects are not significant) in light grey.
Black cells indicate that Loewe additivity is undefined because the combined time-weighted net growth is smaller than at least one of the single-drug minimal net growth rates (see Methods, Data preprocessing).

Polar pharmacodynamic curves for all drug combinations.
For each drug pair, we show one-dimensional cuts through the \(\psi\)-surface splines at \(\phi=45^\circ\) (equal mixing in units of \(\mathrm{zMIC}\)), plotting \(\psi\) as a function of the combined dose \(z\).
The blue dotted line marks \(z=1/\sqrt{2}\), corresponding to both single-drug doses being at \(0.5\,\mathrm{zMIC}\), and the blue dashed line marks \(z=\sqrt{2}\), corresponding to both single-drug concentrations being at \(1\,\mathrm{zMIC}\).
Black, solid curves show the median surface-derived \(\psi\), with corresponding Bliss (orange, dotted) and Loewe (teal, dashed-dotted) predictions evaluated along the same path \((z,\phi)\).
Synergy/Antagonism corresponds to the reference model prediction of $\psi$ being above/below the observed isobole (black).

A curve lying left/below a reference model indicates synergy (less drug is needed to achieve the same effect), whereas a curve lying right/above indicates antagonism (more drug is needed to achieve the same effect).
