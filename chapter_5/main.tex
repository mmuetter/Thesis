With this work, I hope to contribute to a better understanding of the pharmacodynamics of drug interactions; and thereby provide the basis for better models and better informed decision making.
However, we should never forget that models are only simplifications of reality and there is no doubt that the complexities of nature leave enough room for discrovery to further advance the knowledge.
I see my work; not as a specific instruction manual for clinicians, but hope that the abstraction, and formalizations I provided may be useful to others.
